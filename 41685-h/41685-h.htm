<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">LATIN LANGUAGE.<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> 1. <i>Earliest Records of its Area.</i>&mdash;Latin
was the language spoken in Rome and in the plain of Latium
in the 6th or 7th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>&mdash;the earliest period from which
we have any contemporary record of its existence. But it is
as yet impossible to determine either, on the one hand, whether
the archaic inscription of Praeneste (see below), which is assigned
with great probability to that epoch, represents exactly
the language then spoken in Rome; or, on the other, over how
much larger an area of the Italian peninsula, or even of the lands
to the north and west, the same language may at that date
have extended. In the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> we find its limits within
the peninsula fixed on the north-west and south-west by Etruscan
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Etruria</a></span>: <i>Language</i>); on the east, south-east, and probably
north and north-east, by Safine (Sabine) dialects (of the Marsi,
Paeligni, Samnites, Sabini and Picenum, <i>qq.v.</i>); but on the
north we have no direct record of Sabine speech, nor of any
non-Latinian tongue nearer than Tuder and Asculum or earlier
than the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Umbria</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Iguvium</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Picenum</a></span>).
We know however, both from tradition and from the archaeological
data, that the Safine tribes were in the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
migrating, or at least sending off swarms of their younger folk,
farther and farther southward into the peninsula. Of the
languages they were then displacing we have no explicit record
save in the case of Etruscan in Campania, but it may be reasonably
inferred from the evidence of place-names and tribal names,
combined with that of the Faliscan inscriptions, that before
the Safine invasion some idiom, not remote from Latin, was
spoken by the pre-Etruscan tribes down the length of the west
coast (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Falisci</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Volsci</a></span>; also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rome</a></span>: <i>History</i>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Liguria</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Siculi</a></span>).</p>

<p>2. <i>Earliest Roman Inscriptions.</i>&mdash;At Rome, at all events,
it is clear from the unwavering voice of tradition that Latin
was spoken from the beginning of the city. Of the earliest
Latin inscriptions found in Rome which were known in 1909,
the oldest, the so-called &ldquo;Forum inscription,&rdquo; can hardly be referred
with confidence to an earlier century than the 5th; the
later, the well-known <i>Duenos</i> (= later Latin <i>bonus</i>) inscription,
certainly belongs to the 4th; both of these are briefly described
below (¬ß¬ß 40, 41). At this date we have probably the period of
the narrowest extension of Latin; non-Latin idioms were
spoken in Etruria, Umbria, Picenum and in the Marsian and
Volscian hills. But almost directly the area begins to expand
again, and after the war with Pyrrhus the Roman arms had
planted the language of Rome in her military colonies throughout
the peninsula. When we come to the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the
Latin inscriptions begin to be more numerous, and in them
(<i>e.g.</i> the oldest epitaphs of the Scipio family) the language is
very little removed from what it was in the time of Plautus.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Italic Group of Languages.</i>&mdash;For the characteristics
and affinities of the dialects that have just been mentioned, see
the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Italy</a></span>: <i>Ancient Languages and Peoples</i>, and to the
separate articles on the tribes. Here it is well to point out that
the only one of these languages which is not akin to Latin is
Etruscan; on the other hand, the only one very closely resembling
Latin is Faliscan, which with it forms what we may call the
Latinian dialect of the Italic group of the Indo-European family
of languages. Since, however, we have a far more complete
knowledge of Latin than of any other member of the Italic
group, this is the most convenient place in which to state briefly
the very little <span class="correction" title="amended from than">that</span> can be said as yet to have been ascertained
as to the general relations of Italic to its sister groups. Here,
as in many kindred questions, the work of Paul Kretschmer of
Vienna (<i>Einleitung in die Geschichte der griechischen Sprache</i>,
G√∂ttingen, 1896) marked an important epoch in the historical
aspects of linguistic study, as the first scientific attempt to
interpret critically the different kinds of evidence which the
Indo-European languages give us, not in vocabulary merely,
but in phonology, morphology, and especially in their mutual
borrowings, and to combine it with the non-linguistic data of
tradition and archaeology. A certain number of the results so
obtained have met with general acceptance and may be briefly
treated here. It is, however, extremely dangerous to draw
merely from linguistic kinship deductions as to racial identity,
or even as to an original contiguity of habitation. Close resemblances
in any two languages, especially those in their inner
structure (morphology), may be due to identity of race, or to long
neighbourhood in the earliest period of their development; but
they may also be caused by temporary neighbourhood (for a
longer or shorter period), brought about by migrations at a later
epoch (or epochs). A particular change in sound or usage may
spread over a whole chain of dialects and be in the end exhibited
alike by them all, although the time at which it first began was
long after their special and distinctive characteristics had
become clearly marked. For example, the limitation of the
word-accent to the last three syllables of a word in Latin and
Oscan (see below)&mdash;a phenomenon which has left deep marks
on all the Romance languages&mdash;demonstrably grew up between
the 5th and 2nd centuries <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; and it is a permissible conjecture
that it started from the influence of the Greek colonies in Italy
(especially Cumae and Naples), in whose language the same
limitation (although with an accent whose actual character was
probably more largely musical) had been established some
centuries sooner.</p>

<p>4. <i>Position of the Italic Group.</i>&mdash;The Italic group, then, when
compared with the other seven main &ldquo;families&rdquo; of Indo-European
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
speech, in respect of their most significant differences,
ranges itself thus:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(i.) <i>Back-palatal and Velar Sounds.</i>&mdash;In point of its treatment
of the Indo-European back-palatal and velar sounds, it belongs to
the western or <i>centum</i> group, the name of which is, of course, taken
from Latin; that is to say, like German, Celtic and Greek, it did not
sibilate original <i>k</i> and <i>g</i>, which in Indo-Iranian, Armenian, Slavonic
and Albanian have been converted into various types of sibilants
(Ind.-Eur.* <i>k&#7747;tom</i> = Lat. <i>centum</i>, Gr. <i><span class="grk" title="(he)-katon">(&#7953;)-&#954;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#957;</span></i>, Welsh <i>cant</i>, Eng.
<i>hund</i>-(<i>red</i>), but Sans. <i>&#7777;atam</i>, Zend <i>sat&#399;m</i>); but, on the other hand, in
company with just the same three western groups, and in contrast to
the eastern, the Italic languages labialized the original velars (Ind.-Eur.
* <i>qod</i> = Lat. <i>quod</i>, Osc. <i>pod</i>, Gr. <i><span class="grk" title="pod-(apos)">&#960;&#959;&#948;-(&#945;&#960;&#972;&#962;)</span></i>, Welsh <i>pwy</i>, Eng.
<i>what</i>, but Sans. <i>k√°s</i>, &ldquo;who?&rdquo;).</p>

<p>(ii.) <i>Indo-European Aspirates.</i>&mdash;Like Greek and Sanskrit, but
in contrast to all the other groups (even to Zend and Armenian), the
Italic group largely preserves a distinction between the Indo-European
<i>mediae aspiratae</i> and <i>mediae</i> (<i>e.g.</i> between Ind.-Eur. <i>dh</i>
and <i>d</i>, the former when initial becoming initially regularly Lat. <i>f</i> as
in Lat. <i>f&#275;c-&#299;</i> [cf. Umb. <i>feia</i>, &ldquo;<i>faciat</i>&rdquo;], beside Gr. <span class="grk" title="he-th√™k-a">&#7956;-&#952;&#951;&#954;-&#945;</span> [cf. Sans.
<i>da-dh&#257;-ti</i>, &ldquo;he places&rdquo;], the latter simply <i>d</i> as in <i>domus</i>, Gr. <i><span class="grk" title="domos">&#948;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span></i>).
But the <i>aspiratae</i>, even where thus distinctly treated in Italic,
became fricatives, not pure aspirates, a character which they only
retained in Greek and Sanskrit.</p>

<p>(iii.) <i>Indo-European &#335;.</i>&mdash;With Greek and Celtic, Latin preserved
the Indo-European <i>&#335;</i>, which in the more northerly groups (Germanic,
Balto-Slavonic), and also in Indo-Iranian, and, curiously, in
Messapian, was confused with <i>&#259;</i>. The name for olive-oil, which spread
with the use of this commodity from Greek (<span class="grk" title="elaiwon">&#7956;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#989;&#959;&#957;</span>) to Italic
speakers and thence to the north, becoming by regular changes (see
below) in Latin first *<i>√≥laivom</i>, then *<i>√≥leivom</i>, and then taken into
Gothic and becoming <i>al&#275;v</i>, leaving its parent form to change further
(not later than 100 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) in Latin to <i>oleum</i>, is a particularly important
example, because (<i>a</i>) of the chronological limits which are implied,
however roughly, in the process just described, and (<i>b</i>) of the close
association in time of the change of <i>o</i> to <i>a</i> with the earlier stages of
the &ldquo;sound-shifting&rdquo; (of the Indo-European plosives and aspirates)
in German; see Kretschmer, <i>Einleit</i>. p. 116, and the authorities he
cites.</p>

<p>(iv.) <i>Accentuation.</i>&mdash;One marked innovation common to the
western groups as compared with what Greek and Sanskrit show
to have been an earlier feature of the Indo-European parent speech
was the development of a strong expiratory (sometimes called stress)
accent upon the first syllable of all words. This appears early in the
history of Italic, Celtic, Lettish (probably, and at a still later period)
in Germanic, though at a period later than the beginning of the
&ldquo;sound-shifting.&rdquo; This extinguished the complex system of
Indo-European accentuation, which is directly reflected in Sanskrit, and
was itself replaced in Latin and Oscan by another system already
mentioned, but not in Latin till it had produced marked effects upon
the language (<i>e.g.</i> the degradation of the vowels in compounds as in
<i>c&#333;nficio</i> from <i>c√≥n-facio</i>, <i>incl&#363;do</i> from <i>√≠n-claudo</i>). This curious wave
of accentual change (first pointed out by Dieterich, <i>Kuhn&rsquo;s Zeitschrift</i>,
i., and later by Thurneysen, <i>Revue celtique</i>, vi. 312, <i>Rheinisches
Museum</i>, xliii. 349) needs and deserves to be more closely investigated
from a chronological standpoint. At present it is not clear how
far it was a really connected process in all the languages. (See
further Kretschmer, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 115, K. Brugmann, <i>Kurze vergleichende
Grammatik</i> (1902-1904), p. 57, and their citations, especially
Meyer-L√ºbke, <i>Die Betonung im Gallischen</i> (1901).)</p>
</div>

<p>To these larger affinities may be added some important
points in which the Italic group shows marked resemblances to
other groups.</p>

<p>5. <i>Italic and Celtic.</i>&mdash;It is now universally admitted that the
Celtic languages stand in a much closer relation than any other
group to the Italic. It may even be doubted whether there was
any real frontier-line at all between the two groups before
the Etruscan invasion of Italy (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Etruria</a></span>: <i>Language</i>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Liguria</a></span>). The number of morphological innovations on the
Indo-European system which the two groups share, and which
are almost if not wholly peculiar to them, is particularly striking.
Of these the chief are the following.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(i.) Extension of the abstract-noun stems in -<i>ti</i>- (like Greek <i><span class="grk" title="phatis">&#966;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#962;</span></i>
with Attic <i><span class="grk" title="basis">&#946;&#940;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span></i>, &amp;c.) by an -<i>n</i>- suffix, as in Lat. <i>mentio</i> (stem <i>menti&#333;n</i>-)
= Ir. (<i>er</i>-)<i>mitiu</i> (stem <i>miti-n</i>-), contrasted with the same word
without the <i>n</i>-suffix in Sans. <i>mati</i>-, Lat. <i>mens</i>, Ind.-Eur. *<i>m&#7751;-ti</i>-. A
similar extension (shared also by Gothic) appears in Lat. <i>iuvent&#363;-t</i>-,
O. Ir. <i>√≥itiu</i> (stem <i>oili&#363;t</i>-) beside the simple -<i>tu</i>- in nouns like <i>sen&#257;tus</i>.</p>

<p>(ii.) Superlative formation in -<i>is-&#7747;mo</i>- as in Lat. <i>aegerrimus</i> for
*<i>aegr-is&#7747;mos</i>, Gallic <i><span class="grk" title="Ouxisam√™">&#927;&#8016;&#958;&#953;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#951;</span></i> the name of a town meaning &ldquo;the
highest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(iii.) Genitive singular of the <i>o</i>-stems (second declension) in -<i>&#299;</i>
Lat. <i>agri</i>, O. Ir. (Ogam inscriptions) <i>magi</i>, &ldquo;of a son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(iv.) Passive and deponent formation in -<i>r</i>, Lat. <i>sequitur</i> = Ir.
<i>sechedar</i>, &ldquo;he follows.&rdquo; The originally active meaning of this curious
-<i>r</i> suffix was first pointed out by Zimmer (<i>Kuhn&rsquo;s Zeitschrift</i>, 1888,
xxx. 224), who thus explained the use of the accusative pronouns
with these &ldquo;passive&rdquo; forms in Celtic; Ir. -<i>m-berar</i>, &ldquo;I am carried,&rdquo;
literally &ldquo;folk carry me&rdquo;; Umb. <i>pir ferar</i>, literally <i>ignem feratur</i>,
though as <i>pir</i> is a neuter word (= Gr. <span class="grk" title="pyr">&#960;&#8166;&#961;</span>) this example was not so
convincing. But within a twelvemonth of the appearance of
Zimmer&rsquo;s article, an Oscan inscription (Conway, <i>Camb. Philol.
Society&rsquo;s Proceedings</i>, 1890, p. 16, and <i>Italic Dialects</i>, p. 113) was discovered
containing the phrase <i>&#367;ltiumam</i> (<i>i&#367;vilam</i>) <i>sakraf&#7881;r</i>, &ldquo;ultimam
(imaginem) consecraverint&rdquo; (or &ldquo;ultima consecretur&rdquo;)
which demonstrated the nature of the suffix in Italic also. This
originally active meaning of the -<i>r</i> form (in the third person singular
passive) is the cause of the remarkable fondness for the &ldquo;impersonal&rdquo;
use of the passive in Latin (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>itur in antiquam silvam</i>,
instead of <i>eunt</i>), which was naturally extended to all tenses of the
passive (<i>ventum est</i>, &amp;c.), so soon as its origin was forgotten. Fuller
details of the development will be found in Conway, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 561,
and the authorities there cited (very little is added by K. Brugmann,
<i>Kurze vergl. Gramm.</i> 1904, p. 596).</p>

<p>(v.) Formation of the perfect passive from the -<i>to</i>- past participle,
Lat. <i>monitus</i> (<i>est</i>), &amp;c., Ir. <i>l√©ic-the</i>, &ldquo;he was left,&rdquo; <i>ro-l√©iced</i>, &ldquo;he has
been left.&rdquo; In Latin the participle maintains its distinct adjectival
character; in Irish (J. Strachan, <i>Old Irish Paradigms</i>, 1905, p. 50) it
has sunk into a purely verbal form, just as the perfect participles in
-<i>us</i> in Umbrian have been absorbed into the future perfect in -<i>ust</i>
(<i>entelust</i>, &ldquo;intenderit&rdquo;; <i>benust</i>, &ldquo;venerit&rdquo;) with its impersonal passive
or third plural active -<i>us</i>(<i>s</i>)<i>so</i> (probably standing for -<i>ussor</i>) as in
<i>benuso</i>, &ldquo;ventum erit&rdquo; (or &ldquo;venerint&rdquo;).</p>

<p>To these must be further added some striking peculiarities in
phonology.</p>

<p>(vi.) Assimilation of <i>p</i> to a <i>q<span class="sp">&#7799;</span></i> in a following syllable as in Lat.
<i>quinque</i> = Ir. <i>c√≥ic</i>, compared with Sans. <i>p√°nca</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="pente">&#960;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;</span>, Eng. <i>five</i>,
Ind.-Eur. *<i>penqe</i>.</p>

<p>(vii.) Finally&mdash;and perhaps this parallelism is the most important
of all from the historical standpoint&mdash;both Italic and Celtic are
divided into two sub-families which differ, and differ in the same
way, in their treatment of the Ind.-Eur. velar tenuis <i>q</i>. In both
halves of each group it was labialized to some extent; in one half of
each group it was labialized so far as to become <i>p</i>. This is the great
line of cleavage (i.) between Latinian (Lat. <i>quod</i>, <i>quand&#333;</i>, <i>quinque</i>;
Falisc. <i>cuando</i>) and Osco-Umbrian, better called Safine (Osc. <i>pod</i>,
Umb. <i>pan&#363;</i>- [for *<i>pand&#333;</i>], Osc.-Umb. <i>pompe</i>-, &ldquo;five,&rdquo; in Osc.
<i>p&#367;mperias</i> &ldquo;nonae,&rdquo; Umb. <i>pumpe&#7699;ia</i>-, &ldquo;fifth day of the month&rdquo;);
and (ii.) between Goidelic (Gaelic) (O. Ir. <i>c√≥ic</i>, &ldquo;five,&rdquo; <i>maq</i>, &ldquo;son&rdquo;;
modern Irish and Scotch <i>Mac</i> as in <i>MacPherson</i>) and Brythonic
(Britannic) (Welsh <i>pump</i>, &ldquo;five,&rdquo; <i>Ap</i> for map, as in <i>Powel</i> for <i>Ap
Howel</i>).</p>

<p>The same distinction appears elsewhere; Germanic belongs,
broadly described, to the <i>q</i>-group, and Greek, broadly described,
to the <i>p</i>-group. The ethnological bearing of the distinction within
Italy is considered in the articles <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sabini</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Volsci</a></span>; but the wider
questions which the facts suggest have as yet been only scantily
discussed; see the references for the &ldquo;Sequanian&rdquo; dialect of Gallic
(in the inscription of Coligny, whose language preserves <i>q</i>) in the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Celts</a></span>: <i>Language</i>.</p>

<p>From these primitive affinities we must clearly distinguish the
numerous words taken into Latin from the Celts of north Italy within
the historic period; for these see especially an interesting study by
J. Zwicker, <i>De vocabulis et rebus Gallicis sive Transpadanis apud
Vergilium</i> (Leipzig dissertation, 1905).</p>
</div>

<p>6. <i>Greek and Italic.</i>&mdash;We have seen above (¬ß 4, i., ii., iii.) certain
broad characteristics which the Greek and the Italic groups of
language have in common. The old question of the degree of
their affinity may be briefly noticed. There are deep-seated
differences in morphology, phonology and vocabulary between
the two languages&mdash;such as (<i>a</i>) the loss of the forms of the
ablative in Greek and of the middle voice in Latin; (<i>b</i>) the decay
of the fricatives (<i>s</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>&#7725;</i>) in Greek and the cavalier treatment of
the aspirates in Latin; and (<i>c</i>) the almost total discrepancy of
the vocabularies of law and religion in the two languages&mdash;which
altogether forbid the assumption that the two groups can ever
have been completely identical after their first dialectic separation
from the parent language. On the other hand, in the first early
periods of that dialectic development in the Indo-European
family, the precursors of Greek and Italic cannot have been
separated by any very wide boundary. To this primitive
neighbourhood may be referred such peculiarities as (<i>a</i>) the
genitive plural feminine ending in -<i>&#257;s&#333;m</i> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="-a√¥n">-&#940;&#969;&#957;</span>, later in
various dialects <span class="grk" title="-e√¥n">-&#941;&#969;&#957;</span>, <span class="grk" title="-√¥n">-&#8182;&#957;</span>, <span class="grk" title="-an">-&#8118;&#957;</span>; cf. Osc. <i>egmazum</i> &ldquo;rerum&rdquo;;
Lat. <i>mensarum</i>, with -<i>r</i>- from -<i>s</i>-), (<i>b</i>) the feminine gender of
many nouns of the -<i>o</i>- declension, cf. Gr. <span class="grk" title="h√™ hodos">&#7969; &#8001;&#948;&#8056;&#962;</span>, Lat. <i>haec</i>
<i>f&#257;gus</i>; and some important and ancient syntactical features,
especially in the uses of the cases (<i>e.g.</i> (<i>c</i>) the genitive of price)
of the (<i>d</i>) infinitive and of the (<i>e</i>) participles passive (though in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
each case the forms differ widely in the two groups), and perhaps
(<i>f</i>) of the dependent moods (though here again the forms have
been vigorously reshaped in Italic). These syntactic parallels,
which are hardly noticed by Kretschmer in his otherwise careful
discussion (<i>Einleit.</i> p. 155 seq.), serve to confirm his general
conclusion which has been here adopted; because syntactic
peculiarities have a long life and may survive not merely complete
revolutions in morphology, but even a complete change in the
speaker&rsquo;s language, <i>e.g.</i> such Celticisms in Irish-English as
&ldquo;What are you after doing?&rdquo; for &ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; or
in Welsh-English as &ldquo;whatever&rdquo; for &ldquo;anyhow.&rdquo; A few isolated
correspondences in vocabulary, as in <i>remus</i> from *<i>ret-s-mo</i>-,
with <span class="grk" title="eretmos">&#7952;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span> and in a few plant-names (<i>e.g.</i> <span class="grk" title="prason">&#960;&#961;&#940;&#963;&#959;&#957;</span> and <i>porrum</i>),
cannot disturb the general conclusion, though no doubt they
have some historical significance, if it could be determined.</p>

<p>7. <i>Indo-Iranian and Italo-Celtic.</i>&mdash;Only a brief reference can
here be made to the striking list of resemblances between the
Indo-Iranian and Italo-Celtic groups, especially in vocabulary,
which Kretschmer has collected (<i>ibid.</i> pp. 126-144). The most
striking of these are <i>r&#275;x</i>, O. Ir. <i>r&#299;g</i>-, Sans. <i>r&#257;j</i>-, and the political
meaning of the same root in the corresponding verb in both
languages (contrast <i>regere</i> with the merely physical meaning
of Gr. <span class="grk" title="oregnymi">&#8000;&#961;&#941;&#947;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#953;</span>); Lat. <i>fl&#257;men</i> (for *<i>flag-men</i>) exactly = Sans.
<i>brahman</i>- (neuter), meaning probably &ldquo;sacrificing,&rdquo; &ldquo;worshipping,&rdquo;
and then &ldquo;priesthood,&rdquo; &ldquo;priest,&rdquo; from the Ind.-Eur.
root *<i>bhelgh</i>-, &ldquo;blaze,&rdquo; &ldquo;make to blaze&rdquo;; <i>r&#275;s</i>, <i>rem</i> exactly
= Sans. <i>r&#257;s</i>, <i>r&#257;m</i> in declension and especially in meaning; and
<i>&#256;rio</i>-, &ldquo;noble,&rdquo; in Gallic <i>Ariomanus</i>, &amp;c., = Sans. <i>&#257;rya</i>-, &ldquo;noble&rdquo;
(whence &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo;). So <i>argentum</i> exactly = Sans. <i>rajata</i>-, Zend
<i>erezata</i>-; contrast the different (though morphologically kindred)
suffix in Gr. <span class="grk" title="argyros">&#7940;&#961;&#947;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>. Some forty-two other Latin or Celtic
words (among them <i>cr&#275;dere</i>, <i>caesari&#275;s</i>, <i>probus</i>, <i>castus</i> (cf. Osc.
<i>kasit</i>, Lat. <i>caret</i>, Sans. <i>&#353;i&#7779;ta</i>-), <i>Volc&#257;nus</i>, <i>Nept&#363;nus</i>, <i>ensis</i>, <i>erus</i>,
<i>pruina</i>, <i>r&#363;s</i>, <i>nov&#257;cula</i>) have precise Sanskrit or Iranian equivalents,
and none so near in any other of the eight groups of
languages. Finally the use of an -<i>r</i> suffix in the third plural is
common to both Italo-Celtic (see above) and Indo-Iranian.
These things clearly point to a fairly close, and probably in part
political, intercourse between the two communities of speakers
at some early epoch. A shorter, but interesting, list of correspondences
in vocabulary with Balto-Slavonic (<i>e.g.</i> the words
<i>ment&#299;r&#299;</i>, <i>r&#333;s</i>, <i>ignis</i> have close equivalents in Balto-Slavonic)
suggests that at the same period the precursor of this dialect
too was a not remote neighbour.</p>

<p>8. <i>Date of the Separation of the Italic Group.</i>&mdash;The date at
which the Italic group of languages began to have (so far as it
had at all) a separate development of its own is at present only
a matter of conjecture. But the combination of archaeological
and linguistic research which has already begun can have no
more interesting object than the approximate determination
of this date (or group of dates); for it will give us a point of
cardinal importance in the early history of Europe. The only
consideration which can here be offered as a starting-point for
the inquiry is the chronological relation of the Etruscan invasion,
which is probably referable to the 12th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Etruria</a></span>),
to the two strata of Indo-European population&mdash;the -CO- folk
(<i>Falisci</i>, <i>Marruci</i>, <i>Volsci</i>, <i>Hernici</i> and others), to whom the
Tuscan invaders owe the names <i>Etrusci</i> and <i>Tusci</i>, and the
-NO- folk, who, on the West coast, in the centre and south of
Italy, appear at a distinctly later epoch, in some places (as in the
Bruttian peninsula, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bruttii</a></span>) only at the beginning of our
historical record. If the view of Latin as mainly the tongue
of the -CO- folk prove to be correct (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rome</a></span>: <i>History</i>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Italy</a></span>:
<i>Ancient Languages and Peoples</i>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sabini</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Volsci</a></span>) we must
regard it (<i>a</i>) as the southern or earlier half of the Italic group,
firmly rooted in Italy in the 12th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, but (<i>b</i>) by no
means yet isolated from contact with the northern or later
half; such is at least the suggestion of the striking peculiarities
in morphology which it shares with not merely Oscan and
Umbrian, but also, as we have seen, with Celtic. The progress
in time of this isolation ought before long to be traced with
some approach to certainty.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">The History of Latin</span></p>

<p>9. We may now proceed to notice the chief changes that
arose in Latin after the (more or less) complete separation of
the Italic group whenever it came about. The contrasted
features of Oscan and Umbrian, to some of which, for special
reasons, occasional reference will be here made, are fully described
under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Osca Lingua</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Iguvium</a></span> respectively.</p>

<p>It is rarely possible to fix with any precision the date at
which a particular change began or was completed, and the most
serviceable form for this conspectus of the development will
be to present, under the heads of Phonology, Morphology and
Syntax, the chief characteristics of Ciceronian Latin which we
know to have been developed after Latin became a separate
language. Which of these changes, if any, can be assigned to a
particular period will be seen as we proceed. But it should
be remembered that an enormous increase of exact knowledge
has accrued from the scientific methods of research introduced
by A. Leskien and K. Brugmann in 1879, and finally established
by Brugmann&rsquo;s great <i>Grundriss</i> in 1886, and that only a brief
enumeration can be here attempted. For adequate study
reference must be made to the fuller treatises quoted, and
especially to the sections bearing on Latin in K. Brugmann&rsquo;s
<i>Kurze vergleichende Grammatik</i> (1902).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">I. Phonology</span></p>

<p>10. <i>The Latin Accent.</i>&mdash;It will be convenient to begin with some
account of the most important discovery made since the application
of scientific method to the study of Latin, for, though it is not
strictly a part of phonology, it is wrapped up with much of the
development both of the sounds and, by consequence, of the inflexions.
It has long been observed (as we have seen ¬ß 4, iv. above)
that the restriction of the word-accent in Latin to the last three
syllables of the word, and its attachment to a long syllable in the
penult, were certainly not its earliest traceable condition; between
this, the classical system, and the comparative freedom with which
the word-accent was placed in pro-ethnic Indo-European, there had
intervened a period of first-syllable accentuation to which were due
many of the characteristic contractions of Oscan and Umbrian, and
in Latin the degradation of the vowels in such forms as <i>accentus</i> from
<i>ad</i> + <i>cantus</i> or <i>praecipitem</i> from <i>prae</i> + <i>caput</i>- (¬ß 19 below). R. von
Planta (<i>Osk.-Umbr. Grammatik</i>, 1893, i. p. 594) pointed out that in
Oscan also, by the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, this first-syllable-accent had
probably given way to a system which limited the word-accent in
some such way as in classical Latin. But it remained for C. Exon, in
a brilliant article (<i>Hermathena</i> (1906), xiv. 117, seq.), to deduce from
the more precise stages of the change (which had been gradually
noted, see <i>e.g.</i> F. Skutsch in Kroll&rsquo;s <i>Altertumswissenschaft <span class="correction" title="amended from in">im</span>
letzten Vierteljahrhundert</i>, 1905) their actual effect on the language.</p>

<p>11. <i>Accent in Time of Plautus.</i>&mdash;The rules which have been
established for the position of the accent in the time of Plautus are
these:</p>

<div class="list">
<p>(i.) The quantity of the final syllable had no effect on accent.</p>

<p>(ii.) If the penult was long, it bore the accent (<i>am&#257;b&#7845;mus</i>).</p>

<p>(iii.) If the penult was short, then</p>
</div>

<div class="list1">
<p>(<i>a</i>) if the ante-penult was long, it bore the accent (<i>am&#7845;bimus</i>);</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) if the ante-penult was short, then</p>
</div>

<div class="list2">
<p>(i.) if the ante-ante-penult was long, the accent was
on the ante-penult (<i>am&#299;c√≠tia</i>); but</p>

<p>(ii.) if the ante-ante-penult was also short, it bore the
accent (<i>c√≥lumine, pu√©ritia</i>).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Exon&rsquo;s Laws of Syncope.</i>&mdash;With these facts are now linked what
may be called Exon&rsquo;s Laws, viz:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>In pre-Plautine Latin</i> in all words or word-groups of four or more
syllables whose chief accent is on one long syllable, a short unaccented
medial vowel was syncopated; thus *<i>qu√≠nquedecem</i>
became *<i>qu√≠nqdecem</i> and thence <i>qu√≠ndecim</i> (for the -<i>im</i> see ¬ß 19),
*<i>s√∫ps-emere</i> became *<i>s√∫psmere</i> and that <i>s&#363;mere</i> (on -<i>psm- v. inf.</i>)
*<i>s√∫rregere</i>, *<i>surreg<span class="ov">√©</span>mus</i>, and the like became <i>surgere</i>, <i>surg<span class="ov">√©</span>mus</i>, and
the rest of the paradigm followed; so probably <i>valid<span class="ov">√©</span> bonus</i> became
<i>vald<span class="ov">√©</span> bonus</i>, <i>exter<span class="ov">√°</span> viam</i> became <i>extr<span class="ov">√°</span> viam</i>; so *<i>supo-t√©ndo</i> became
<i>subtendo</i> (pronounced <i>sup-tendo</i>), *<i>&#257;rid<span class="ov">√©</span>re</i>, *<i>avid<span class="ov">√©</span>re</i> (from <i>&#257;ridus</i>,
<i>avidus</i>) became <i>&#257;rd<span class="ov">√©</span>re</i>, <i>aud<span class="ov">√©</span>re</i>. But the influence of cognate forms
often interfered; <i>poster<span class="ov">√≠</span>-di&#275;</i> became <i>postr√≠di&#275;</i>, but in <i>poster<span class="ov">√≥</span>rum</i>,
<i>poster<span class="ov">√°</span>rum</i> the short syllable was restored by the influence of the
trisyllabic cases, <i>p√≥sterus</i>, <i>p√≥ster&#299;</i>, &amp;c., to which the law did not
apply. Conversely, the nom. *<i><span class="ov">√°</span>ridor</i> (more correctly at this period
*<i>&#257;rid&#333;s</i>), which would not have been contracted, followed the form
of <i>&#257;rd<span class="ov">√≥</span>rem</i> (from *<i>&#257;rid<span class="ov">√≥</span>rem</i>), <i>&#257;rd<span class="ov">√©</span>re</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The same change produced the monosyllabic forms <i>nec</i>, <i>ac</i>, <i>neu</i>,
<i>seu</i>, from <i>neque</i>, &amp;c., before consonants, since they had no accent of
their own, but were always pronounced in one breath with the
following word, <i>neque t√°ntum</i> becoming <i>nec tantum</i>, and the like.
So in Plautus (and probably always in spoken Latin) the words
<i>nemp</i>(<i>e</i>), <i>ind</i>(<i>e</i>), <i>quipp</i>(<i>e</i>), <i>ill</i>(<i>e</i>), are regularly monosyllables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span></p>

<p>12. <i>Syncope of Final Syllables.</i>&mdash;It is possible that the frequent but
far from universal syncope of final syllables in Latin (especially
before -<i>s</i>, as in <i>m&#275;ns</i>, which represents both Gr. <span class="grk" title="menos">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> and Sans.
mat√≠s = Ind.-Eur. <i>m&#7751;t√≠s</i>, Eng. <i>mind</i>) is due also to this law operating
on such combinations as <i>bona m&#275;ns</i> and the like, but this has not
yet been clearly shown. In any case the effects of any such phonetic
change have been very greatly modified by analogical changes.
The Oscan and Umbrian syncope of short vowels before final <i>s</i>
seems to be an independent change, at all events in its detailed
working. The outbreak of the unconscious affection of slurring
final syllables may have been contemporaneous.</p>

<p>13. <i>In post-Plautine Latin</i> words accented on the ante-antepenult:&mdash;</p>

<p>(i.) suffered syncope in the short syllable following the accented
syllable (<i>b√°lineae</i> became <i>b√°lneae</i>, <i>pu√©ritia</i> became <i>pu√©rtia</i> (Horace),
<i>c√≥lumine</i>, <i>t√©gimine</i>, &amp;c., became <i>c√∫lmine</i>, <i>t√©gmine</i>, &amp;c., beside the
trisyllabic <i>c√≥lumen</i>, <i>t√©gimen</i>) unless</p>

<p>(ii.) that short vowel was <i>e</i> or <i>i</i>, followed by another vowel (as in
<i>p√°rietem</i>, <i>m√∫lierem</i>, <i>P√∫teoli</i>), when, instead of contraction, the
accent shifted to the penult, which at a later stage of the language
became lengthened, <i>pari√©tem</i> giving Ital. <i>par√©&#7871;te</i>, Fr. <i>paroi</i>, <i>Pute√≥li</i>
giving Ital. <i>Pozzu&#7889;li</i>.</p>

<p>The restriction of the accent to the last three syllables was completed
by these changes, which did away with all the cases in which it
had stood on the fourth syllable.</p>

<p>14. <i>The Law of the Brevis Brevians.</i>&mdash;Next must be mentioned
another great phonetic change, also dependent upon accent, which
had come about before the time of Plautus, the law long known to
students as the <i>Brevis Brevians</i>, which may be stated as follows
(Exon, <i>Hermathena</i> (1903), xii. 491, following Skutsch in, <i>e.g.</i>,
Vollm√∂ller&rsquo;s <i>Jahresbericht f√ºr romanische Sprachwissenschaft</i>, i. 33):
a syllable long by nature or position, and preceded by a short
syllable, was itself shortened if the word-accent fell immediately
before or immediately after it&mdash;that is, on the preceding short
syllable or on the next following syllable. The sequence of syllables
need not be in the same word, but must be as closely connected in
utterance as if it were. Thus <i>m&#7889;d&#333;</i> became <i>m√≥d&#335;</i>, <i>v&#335;l&#363;pt&#7845;t&#275;m</i> became
<i>v&#335;l&#365;(p)t&#7845;tem</i>, <i>qu&#7727;d &#275;st?</i> became <i>quid &#277;st?</i> either the <i>s</i> or the <i>t</i> or both
being but faintly pronounced.</p>

<p>It is clear that a great number of flexional syllables so shortened
would have their quantity immediately restored by the analogy of
the same inflexion occurring in words not of this particular shape;
thus, for instance, the long vowel of <i>&#7845;m&#257;</i> and the like is due to that
in other verbs (<i>puls&#257;</i>, <i>agit&#257;</i>) not of iambic shape. So ablatives like
<i>mod√∂</i>, <i>son&#333;</i> get back their -<i>&#333;</i>, while in particles like <i>modo</i>, &ldquo;only,&rdquo;
<i>qu&#333;modo</i>, &ldquo;how,&rdquo; the shortened form remains. Conversely, the
shortening of the final -<i>a</i> in the nom. sing. fem. of the <i>a</i>-declension
(contrast <i>l&#363;n&#259;</i> with Gr. <span class="grk" title="ch√¥r√£">&#967;&#969;&#961;&#8119;</span>) was probably partly due to the
influence of common forms like <i>e&#259;</i>, <i>bon&#259;</i>, <i>mal&#259;</i>, which had come under
the law.</p>

<p>15. <i>Effect on Verb Inflexion.</i>&mdash;These processes had far-reaching
effects on Latin inflexion. The chief of these was the creation of the
type of conjugation known as the <i>capio</i>-class. All these verbs were
originally inflected like <i>audio</i>, but the accident of their short root-syllable,
(in such early forms as *<i>f√∫g&#299;s</i>, *<i>fug&#299;t&#7801;rus</i>, *<i>fug&#299;s&#7871;tis</i>, &amp;c.,
becoming later <i>f√∫g&#301;s</i>, <i>fug&#301;t&#7801;rus</i>, <i>fug&#277;r&#7871;tis</i>) brought great parts of their
paradigm under this law, and the rest followed suit; but true forms
like <i>fug&#299;re</i>, <i>cup&#299;re</i>, <i>mor&#299;ri</i>, never altogether died out of the spoken
language. St Augustine, for instance, confessed in 387 <span class="scs">A.D.</span> (<i>Epist.</i>
iii. 5, quoted by Exon, <i>Hermathena</i> (1901), xi. 383,) that he does not
know whether <i>cupi</i> or <i>cupiri</i> is the pass. inf. of <i>cupio</i>. Hence we
have Ital. <i>fugg&#299;re</i>, <i>mor&#299;re</i>, Fr. <i>fuir</i>, <i>mourir</i>. (See further on this
conjugation, C. Exon, <i>l.c.</i>, and F. Skutsch, <i>Archiv f√ºr lat. Lexicographie</i>,
xii. 210, two papers which were written independently.)</p>

<p>16. The question has been raised how far the true phonetic shortening
appears in Plautus, produced not by word-accent but by metrical
ictus&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> whether the reading is to be trusted in such lines as <i>Amph.</i>
761, which gives us <i>dedisse</i> as the first foot (tribrach) of a trochaic
line &ldquo;because the metrical ictus fell on the syllable <i>ded</i>-&rdquo;&mdash;but this
remarkable theory cannot be discussed here. See the articles cited
and also F. Skutsch, <i>Forschungen zu Latein. Grammatik und Metrik</i>,
i. (1892); C. Exon, <i>Hermathena</i> (1903) xii. p. 492, W. M. Lindsay,
<i>Captivi</i> (1900), appendix.</p>

<p>In the history of the vowels and diphthongs in Latin we must
distinguish the changes which came about independently of accent
and those produced by the preponderance of accent in another syllable.</p>

<p>17. <i>Vowel Changes independent of Accent.</i>&mdash;In the former category
the following are those of chief importance:&mdash;</p>

<p>(i.) <i>&#301;</i> became <i>&#277;</i> (<i>a</i>) when final, as in <i>ant-e</i> beside Gr. <span class="grk" title="anti">&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#943;</span>, <i>tr&#299;ste</i>
besides <i>tr&#299;sti-s</i>, contrasted with <i>e.g.</i>, the Greek neuter <span class="grk" title="idri">&#7988;&#948;&#961;&#953;</span> (the final
-<i>e</i> of the infinitive&mdash;<i>regere</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;is the -<i>&#301;</i> of the locative, just as in the
so-called ablatives <i>genere</i>, &amp;c.); (<i>b</i>) before -<i>r</i>- which has arisen from
-<i>s</i>-, as in <i>cineris</i> beside <i>cinis</i>, <i>cinisculus</i>; <i>ser&#333;</i> beside Gr. <span class="grk" title="i(s)√™mi">&#7988;(&#963;)&#951;&#956;&#953;</span> (Ind.-Eur.
*<i>si-s&#275;mi</i>, a reduplicated non-thematic present).</p>

<p>(ii.) Final <i>&#335;</i> became <i>&#277;</i>; imperative <i>sequere</i> = Gr. <span class="grk" title="epe(s)o">&#7956;&#960;&#949;(&#963;)&#959;</span>; Lat. <i>ille</i>
may contain the old pronoun *<i>so</i>, &ldquo;he,&rdquo; Gr. <span class="grk" title="ho">&#8001;</span>, Sans. <i>sa</i> (otherwise
Skutsch, <i>Glotta</i>, i. Hefte 2-3).</p>

<p>(iii.) <i>el</i> became <i>ol</i> when followed by any sound save <i>e</i>, <i>i</i> or <i>l</i>, as in
<i>vol&#333;</i>, <i>volt</i> beside <i>velle</i>; <i>col&#333;</i> beside Gr. <span class="grk" title="tellomai">&#964;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</span>, <span class="grk" title="polein">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>, Att. <span class="grk" title="telos">&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>;
<i>col&#333;nus</i> for *<i>quel&#333;nus</i>, beside <i>inquil&#299;nus</i> for *<i>en-qu&#275;lenus</i>.</p>

<p>(iv.) <i>e</i> became <i>i</i> (i.) before a nasal followed by a palatal or velar
consonant (<i>tingo</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="tegg√¥">&#964;&#941;&#947;&#947;&#969;</span>; <i>in-cipio</i> from *<i>en-capio</i>); (ii.) under
certain conditions not yet precisely defined, one of which was <i>i</i> in a
following syllable (<i>nihil</i>, <i>nisi</i>, <i>initium</i>). From these forms <i>in</i>- spread
and banished <i>en</i>-, the earlier form.</p>

<p>(v.) The &ldquo;neutral vowel&rdquo; (&ldquo;schwa Indo-Germanicum&rdquo;) which
arose in pro-ethnic Indo-European from the reduction of long
<i>&#257;</i>, <i>&#275;</i> or <i>&#333;</i> in unaccented syllables (as in the -<i>t√≥s</i> participles of such roots
as <i>st&#257;</i>-, <i>dh&#275;</i>-, <i>d&#333;</i>-, *<i>st&#399;t√≥s</i>, *<i>dh&#399;t√≥s</i>, *<i>d&#399;t√≥s</i>) became <i>a</i> in Latin (<i>status
con-ditus</i> [from *<i>con-dhatos</i>], <i>datus</i>), and it is the same sound which
is represented by <i>a</i> in most of the forms of <i>d&#333;</i> (<i>damus</i>, <i>dab&#333;</i>, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>(vi.) When a long vowel came to stand before another vowel in
the same word through loss of <i>&#7725;</i> or <i><span class="sp">&#7799;</span></i>, it was always shortened; thus
the -<i>e&#333;</i> of intransitive verbs like <i>cande&#333;</i>, <i>cale&#333;</i> is for -<i>&#275;&#7725;&#333;</i> (where the <i>&#275;</i>
is identical with the &eta; in Gr. <span class="grk" title="ephan√™n">&#7952;&#966;&#940;&#957;&#951;&#957;</span>, <span class="grk" title="eman√™n">&#7952;&#956;&#940;&#957;&#956;&#957;</span>) and was thus confused
with the causative -<i>ei&#333;</i> (as in <i>mone&#333;</i>, &ldquo;I make to think,&rdquo; &amp;c.), where
the short <i>e</i> is original. So <i>aud&#299;u&#299;</i> became <i>aud&#299;&#299;</i> and thence <i>audi&#299;</i>
(the form aud&#299;v&#299; would have disappeared altogether but for being
restored from <i>aud&#299;veram</i>, &amp;c.; conversely <i>audieram</i> is formed from
<i>audi&#299;</i>). In certain cases the vowels contracted, as in <i>tr&#275;s</i>, <i>part&#275;s</i>, &amp;c.
with -<i>&#275;s</i> from <i>e&#7725;es</i>, *<i>am&#333;</i> from <i>am&#257;(&#7725;)&#333;</i>.</p>

<p>18. <i>Of the Diphthongs.</i></p>

<p>(vii.) <i>eu</i> became <i>ou</i> in pro-ethnic Italic, Lat. <i>novus</i>: Gr. <span class="grk" title="neos">&#957;&#941;&#959;&#962;</span>,
Lat. <i>novem</i>, Umb. <i>nuviper</i> (<i>i.e.</i> <i>noviper</i>), &ldquo;usque ad
<span class="sidenote">Changes of the diphthongs independent of accent.</span>
noviens&rdquo;: Gr. <span class="grk" title="(en-)nea">(&#7952;&#957;-)&#957;&#941;&#945;</span>; in unaccented syllables this
-<i>ov</i>- sank to -<i>u(v)</i>- as in <i>d&#7871;nu&#333;</i> from <i>d&#7871; nov&#333;</i>, <i>suus</i> (which is
rarely anything but an enclitic word), Old Lat. <i>sovos</i>:
Gr. <span class="grk" title="he(w)os">&#7953;(&#989;)&#972;&#962;</span>.</p>

<p>(viii.) <i>ou</i>, whether original or from <i>eu</i>, when in one syllable
became -<i>&#363;</i>-, probably about 200 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, as in <i>d&#363;c&#333;</i>, Old Lat. <i>douc&#333;</i>,
Goth, <i>tiuhan</i>, Eng. <i>tow</i>, Ind.-Eur. *<i>de<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>c&#333;</i>.</p>

<p>(ix.) <i>ei</i> became <i>&#299;</i> (as in <i>d&#299;c&#333;</i>, Old Lat. <i>deico</i>: Gr. <span class="grk" title="deik">&#948;&#949;&#943;&#954;</span>-<span class="grk" title="nymi">&#957;&#965;&#956;&#953;</span>, <i>f&#299;do</i>: Gr.
<span class="grk" title="peithomai">&#960;&#949;&#943;&#952;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</span>, Ind.-Eur. *<i>bheidh&#333;</i>) just before the time of Lucilius, who
prescribes the spellings <i>puerei</i> (nom. plur.) but <i>puer&#299;</i> (gen. sing.),
which indicates that the two forms were pronounced alike in his
time, but that the traditional distinction in spelling had been more
or less preserved. But after his time, since the sound of <i>ei</i> was
merely that of <i>&#299;</i>, <i>ei</i> is continually used merely to denote a long <i>&#299;</i>, even
where, as in <i>faxeis</i> for fax&#299;s, there never had been any diphthongal
sound at all.</p>

<p>(x.) In rustic Latin (Volscian and Sabine) <i>au</i> became <i>&#333;</i> as in the
vulgar terms <i>expl&#333;dere</i>, <i>pl&#333;strum</i>. Hence arose interesting doublets
of meaning;&mdash;<i>lautus</i> (the Roman form), &ldquo;elegant,&rdquo; but <i>l&#333;tus</i>,
&ldquo;washed&rdquo;; <i>haustus</i>, &ldquo;draught,&rdquo; but <i>h&#333;stus</i> (Cato), &ldquo;the season&rsquo;s
yield of fruit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(xi.) <i>oi</i> became <i>oe</i> and thence <i>&#363;</i> some time after Plautus, as in
<i>&#363;nus</i>, Old Lat. <i>oenus</i>: Gr. <span class="grk" title="oin√™">&#959;&#7984;&#957;&#942;</span> &ldquo;ace.&rdquo; In Plautus the forms have
nearly all been modernized, save in special cases, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Trin.</i> i.
1, 2, <i>immoene facinus</i>, &ldquo;a thankless task,&rdquo; has not been changed to
<i>immune</i> because that meaning had died out of the adjective so that
<i>immune facinus</i> would have made nonsense; but at the end of the
same line <i>utile</i> has replaced <i>oetile</i>. Similarly in a small group of
words the old form was preserved through their frequent use in legal
or religious documents where tradition was strictly preserved&mdash;<i>poena</i>,
<i>foedus</i> (neut.), <i>foedus</i> (adj.), &ldquo;ill-omened.&rdquo; So the archaic
and poetical <i>moenia</i>, &ldquo;ramparts,&rdquo; beside the true classical form
<i>m&#363;nia</i>, &ldquo;duties&rdquo;; the historic <i>Poeni</i> beside the living and frequently
used <i>P&#363;nicum</i> (<i>bellum</i>)&mdash;an example which demonstrates conclusively
(<i>pace</i> Sommer) that the variation between <i>&#363;</i> and <i>oe</i> is not
due to any difference in the surrounding sounds.</p>

<p>(xii.) <i>ai</i> became <i>ae</i> and this in rustic and later Latin (2nd or 3rd
century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>) simple <i>&#275;</i>, though of an open quality&mdash;Gr. <span class="grk" title="aithos">&#945;&#7988;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>, <span class="grk" title="aith√¥">&#945;&#7988;&#952;&#969;</span>,
Lat. <i>aed&#275;s</i> (originally &ldquo;the place for the fire&rdquo;); the country forms
of <i>haedus</i>, <i>praetor</i> were <i>edus</i>, <i>pretor</i> (Varro, <i>Ling. Lat.</i> v. 97, Lindsay,
<i>Lat. Lang.</i> p. 44).</p>

<p>19. <i>Vowels and Diphthongs in unaccented Syllables.</i>&mdash;The changes
of the short vowels and of the diphthongs in unaccented syllables are
too numerous and complex to be set forth here. Some took place
under the first-syllable system of accent, some later (¬ß¬ß 9, 10).
Typical examples are <i>pep</i>E<i>rci</i> from *<i>p√©parcai</i> and <i>√≥nustus</i> from
*<i>√≥nostos</i> (before two consonants); <i>concIno</i> from *<i>c√≥ncano</i> and <i>hosp</i>I<i>t</i>I<i>s</i>
from *<i>h√≥stipotes</i>, <i>leg</i>I<i>mus</i> beside Gr. <span class="grk" title="legomen">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> (before one consonant);
<i>Sic</i>U<i>li</i> from *<i>Siceloi</i> (before a thick <i>l</i>, see ¬ß 17, 3); <i>dil</i>I<i>g</i>I<i>t</i> from
*<i>d√≠sleget</i> (contrast, however, the preservation of the second <i>e</i> in
<i>negl</i>E<i>g</i>I<i>t</i>); <i>occ</i>U<i>pat</i> from *<i>opcapat</i> (contrast <i>accipit</i> with <i>i</i> in the
following syllable); the varying spelling in <i>monumentum</i> and
<i>monimentum</i>, <i>maxumus</i> and <i>maximus</i>, points to an intermediate sound
(<i>√º</i>) between <i>u</i> and <i>i</i> (cf. Quint. i. 4. 8, reading <i>optumum</i> and <i>optimum</i>
[not <i>opimum</i>] with W. M. Lindsay, <i>Latin Language</i> ¬ß¬ß 14, 16, seq.),
which could not be correctly represented in spelling; this difference
may, however, be due merely to the effect of differences in the
neighbouring sounds, an effect greatly obscured by analogical influences.</p>

<p>Inscriptions of the 4th or 3rd century, <span class="scs">B.C.</span> which show original
-<i>es</i> and -<i>os</i> in final syllables (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Vener&#277;s</i>, gen. sing., <i>n&#257;vebos</i> abl. pl.)
compared with the usual forms in -<i>is</i>, -<i>us</i> a century later, give us
roughly the date of these changes. But final -<i>os</i>, -<i>om</i>, remained after
-<i>u</i>- (and <i>v</i>) down to 50 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> as in <i>servos</i>.</p>

<p>20. Special mention should be made of the change of -<i>r&#301;</i>- and -<i>ro</i>-
to -<i>er</i>- (<i>incertus</i> from *<i>encritos</i>; <i>ager</i>, <i>&#257;cer</i> from *<i>agros</i>, *<i>&#257;cris</i>; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span>
feminine <i>&#257;cris</i> was restored in Latin (though not in North Oscan) by
the analogy of other adjectives, like <i>tristis</i>, while the masculine <i>&#257;cer</i>
was protected by the parallel masculine forms of the -<i>o</i>- declension,
like <i>tener</i>, <i>niger</i> [from *<i>teneros</i>, *<i>nigros</i>]).</p>

<p>21. Long vowels generally remained unchanged, as in <i>comp&#257;go</i>,
<i>cond&#333;no</i>.</p>

<p>22. Of the diphthongs, <i>ai</i> and <i>oi</i> both sank to <i>ei</i>, and with original
<i>ei</i> further to <i>&#299;</i>, in unaccented syllables, as in <i>Achivi</i> from Gr. <span class="grk" title="Achaiwoi">&#7944;&#967;&#945;&#953;&#989;&#959;&#943;</span>,
<i>ol&#299;ivom</i>, earlier *<i>oleivom</i> (borrowed into Gothic and there becoming
<i>al&#275;v</i>) from Gr. <span class="grk" title="elaiwon">&#7956;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#989;&#959;&#957;</span>. This gives us interesting chronological data,
since the <i>el</i>- must have changed to <i>ol</i>- (¬ß 16. 3) before the change of
-<i>ai</i>- to -<i>ei</i>-, and that before the change of the accent from the first
syllable to the penultimate (¬ß 9); and the borrowing took place after
-<i>ai</i>- had become -<i>ei</i>-, but before -<i>eivom</i> had become -<i>eum</i>, as it regularly
did before the time of Plautus.</p>

<p>But cases of <i>ai</i>, <i>ae</i>, which arose later than the change to <i>ei</i>, <i>&#299;</i>,
were unaffected by it; thus the nom. plur. of the first declension
originally ended in -<i>&#257;s</i> (as in Oscan), but was changed at some period
before Plautus to -<i>ae</i> by the influence of the pronominal nom. plur.
ending -<i>ae</i> in <i>quae</i>? <i>hae</i>, &amp;c., which was accented in these monosyllables
and had therefore been preserved. The history of the -<i>ae</i>
of the dative, genitive and locative is hardly yet clear (see Exon,
<i>Hermathena</i> (1905), xiii. 555; K. Brugmann, <i>Grundriss</i>, 1st ed. ii.
571, 601).</p>

<p>The diphthongs <i>au</i>, <i>ou</i> in unaccented syllables sank to -<i>u</i>-, as in
<i>incl&#363;d&#333;</i> beside <i>claud&#333;</i>; the form <i>cl&#363;d&#333;</i>, taken from the compounds,
superseded <i>claudo</i> altogether after Cicero&rsquo;s time. So <i>c&#363;d&#333;</i>, taken
from <i>inc&#363;d&#333;</i>, <i>exc&#363;d&#333;</i>, banished the older *<i>caud&#333;</i>, &ldquo;I cut, strike,&rdquo;
with which is probably connected <i>cauda</i>, &ldquo;the striking member,
tail,&rdquo; and from which comes <i>caussa</i>, &ldquo;a cutting, decision, legal case,&rdquo;
whose -<i>ss</i>- shows that it is derived from a root ending in a dental
(see ¬ß25 (<i>b</i>) below and Conway, <i>Verner&rsquo;s Law in Italy</i>, p. 72).</p>

<p><i>Consonants.</i>&mdash;Passing now to the chief changes of the consonants
we may notice the following points:&mdash;</p>

<p>23. Consonant <i>i</i> (wrongly written <i>j</i>; there is no <i>g</i>-sound in the
letter), conveniently written <i>&#7725;</i> by phoneticians,</p>

<p>(i.) was lost between vowels, as in <i>tr&#275;s</i> for *<i>tre&#7725;es</i>, &amp;c. (¬ß
17. 6);</p>

<p>(ii.) in combination: -<i>m&#7725;</i>- became -<i>ni</i>-, as in <i>veni√∂</i>, from Ind.-Eur.
*&#423;<span class="f80">&#7799;</span> <i>m&#7725;o</i>, &ldquo;I come,&rdquo; Sans. <i>gam</i>-, Eng. <i>come</i>; -<i>n&#7725;</i>- probably (under
certain conditions at least) became -<i>nd</i>-, as in <i>tend&#333;</i> beside Gr. <span class="grk" title="tein√¥">&#964;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#969;</span>,
<i>fend&#333;</i> = Gr. <span class="grk" title="thein√¥">&#952;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#969;</span>, and in the gerundive stem -<i>endus</i>, -<i>undus</i>, probably
for -<i>en&#7725;os</i>, -<i>on&#7725;os</i>; cf. the Sanskrit gerundive in -<i>an-&#299;ya-s</i>; -<i>g&#7725;</i>-, -<i>d&#7725;</i>-
became -<i>&#7725;</i>- as in <i>m&#257;ior</i> from *<i>mag-ior</i>, <i>p&#275;ior</i> from *<i>ped-ior</i>;</p>

<p>(iii.) otherwise -<i>&#7725;</i>- after a consonant became generally syllabic
(-<i>i&#7725;</i>-), as in <i>capi&#333;</i> (trisyllabic) beside Goth. <i>hafya</i>.</p>

<p>24. Consonant <i>u</i> (formerly represented by English <i>v</i>), conveniently
written <i><span class="sp">&#7799;</span></i>,</p>

<p>(i.) was lost between similar vowels when the first was accented,
as in <i>aud&#299;ui</i>, which became <i>audi&#299;</i> (¬ß 17 [6]), but not in <i>am&#257;u&#299;</i>, nor in
<i>av&#257;rus</i>.</p>

<p>(ii.) in combination: <i>d<span class="sp">&#7799;</span></i> became <i>b</i>, as in <i>bonus</i>, <i>bellum</i>, O. Lat.
<i>d<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>onus</i>, *<i>d<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>ellum</i> (though the poets finding this written form in old
literary sources treated it as trisyllabic); <i>p<span class="sp">&#7799;</span></i>-, <i>f<span class="sp">&#7799;</span></i>-, <i>b<span class="sp">&#7799;</span></i>-, lost the <i><span class="sp">&#7799;</span></i>,
as in <i>ap-erio</i>, <i>op-erio</i> beside Lith. -<i>veriu</i>, &ldquo;I open,&rdquo; Osc. <i>veru</i>, &ldquo;gate,&rdquo;
and in the verbal endings -<i>bam</i>, -<i>b&#333;</i>, from -<i>bh<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>-&#257;m</i>, -<i>bh<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>&#333;</i> (with the
root of Lat. <i>fui</i>), and <i>f&#299;o</i>, <i>du-bius</i>, <i>super-bus</i>, <i>vasta-bundus</i>, &amp;c.,
from the same; -<i>s<span class="sp">&#7799;</span></i>- between vowels (at least when the second was
accented) disappeared (see below ¬ß 25 (<i>a</i>), iv.), as in <i>pru&#299;na</i> for <i>prusu&#299;na</i>,
cf. Eng. <i>fros-t</i>, Sans, <i>pru&#7779;v&#257;</i>, &ldquo;hoar-frost.&rdquo; Contrast <i>Min√©rva</i>
from an earlier *<i>menes-<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>&#257;</i>, <i>s<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>e</i>-, <i>s<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>o</i>-, both became so-, as in <i>sor&#333;or</i>(<i>em</i>)
beside Sans. <i>svas&#257;r-am</i>, Ger. <i>schwes-t-er</i>, Eng. <i>sister</i>, <i>sord&#275;s</i>, beside
O. Ger. <i>swart-s</i>, mod. <i>schwarz</i>. -<i><span class="sp">&#7799;</span>o</i>- in final syllables became -<i>u</i>-,
as in <i>cum</i> from <i>quom</i>, <i>parum</i> from <i>par<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>om</i>; but in the declensional
forms -<i><span class="sp">&#7799;</span>u</i>- was commonly restored by the analogy of the other cases,
thus (<i>a</i>) <i>ser<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>os</i>, <i>ser<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>om</i>, <i>ser<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>&#299;</i> became (<i>b</i>) *<i>serus</i>, *<i>serum</i>, *<i>ser<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>i</i>, but
finally (<i>c</i>) <i>ser<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>us</i>, <i>ser<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>um</i>, <i>ser<span class="sp">&#7799;</span>i</i>.</p>

<p>(iii.) In the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, Lat. <i>v</i> (<i>i.e.</i> <i><span class="sp">&#7799;</span></i>) had become a voiced
labio-dental fricative, like Eng. <i>v</i>; and the voiced labial plosive <i>b</i>
had broken down (at least in certain positions) into the same sound;
hence they are frequently confused as in spellings like <i>vene</i> for <i>bene</i>,
<i>Bictorinus</i> for <i>Victorinus</i>.</p>

<p>25. (<i>a</i>) Latin <i>s</i></p>

<p>(i.) became <i>r</i> between vowels between 450 and 350 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (for the
date see R. S. Conway, <i>Verner&rsquo;s Law in Italy</i>, pp. 61-64), as <i>&#257;ra</i>,
beside O. Lat. <i>&#257;sa</i>, <i>generis</i> from *<i>geneses</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="geneos">&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#959;&#962;</span>; <i>eram</i>, <i>er&#333;</i> for
*<i>es&#257;m</i>, *<i>es&#333;</i>, and so in the verbal endings -<i>er&#257;m</i>, -<i>er&#333;</i>, -<i>erim</i>. But a
considerable number of words came into Latin, partly from neighbouring
dialects, with -<i>s</i>- between vowels, after 350 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, when the
change ceased, and so show -<i>s</i>-, as <i>rosa</i> (probably from S. Oscan for
*<i>rod&#7725;a</i> &ldquo;rose-bush&rdquo; cf. Gr. <span class="grk" title="rhodon">&#8165;&#972;&#948;&#959;&#957;</span>), <i>c&#257;seus</i>, &ldquo;cheese,&rdquo; <i>miser</i>, a term
of abuse, beside Gr. <span class="grk" title="mysaros">&#956;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#961;&#972;&#962;</span> (probably also borrowed from south
Italy), and many more, especially the participles in -<i>sus</i> (<i>f&#363;sus</i>),
where the -<i>s</i>- was -<i>ss</i>- at the time of the change of -<i>s</i>- to -<i>r</i>- (so in
<i>causa</i>, see above). All attempts to explain the retention of the -<i>s</i>-
otherwise must be said to have failed (<i>e.g.</i> the theory of accentual
difference in <i>Verner&rsquo;s Law in Italy</i>, or that of dissimilation, given by
Brugmann, <i>Kurze vergl. Gram.</i> p. 242).</p>

<p>(ii.) <i>sr</i> became <i>√ær</i> (= Eng. <i>thr</i> in <i>throw</i>) in pro-ethnic Italic, and
this became initially <i>fr</i>- as in <i>fr&#299;gus</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="rhigos">&#8165;&#8150;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> (Ind.-Eur. *<i>sr&#299;gos</i>), but
medially -<i>br</i>-, as in <i>funebris</i>, from <i>funus</i>, stem <i>funes</i>-.</p>

<p>(iii.) -<i>rs</i>-, <i>ls</i>- became -<i>rr</i>-, -<i>ll</i>-, as in <i>ferre</i>, <i>velle</i>, for *<i>fer-se</i>, *<i>vel-se</i>
(cf. <i>es-se</i>).</p>

<p>(iv.) Before <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>l</i>, and <i>v</i>, -<i>s</i>- vanished, having previously caused
the loss of any preceding plosive or -<i>n</i>-, and the preceding vowel, if
short, was lengthened as in</p>

<div class="list">
<p><i>pr&#299;mus</i> from *<i>prismos</i>, Paelig. <i>prismu</i>, &ldquo;prima,&rdquo; beside <i>pris-cus</i>.</p>

<p><i>i&#363;mentum</i> from O. Lat. <i>iouxmentum</i>, older *<i>ieugsmentom</i>; cf.
Gr. <span class="grk" title="zeugma">&#950;&#949;&#8166;&#947;&#956;&#945;</span>, <span class="grk" title="zygon">&#950;&#973;&#947;&#959;&#957;</span>, Lat. <i>iugum</i>, <i>iungo</i>.</p>

<p><i>l&#363;na</i> from *<i>leucsn&#257;</i>-, Praenest, <i>losna</i>, Zend <i>rao&chi;sna</i>-; cf.
Gr. <span class="grk" title="leukos">&#955;&#949;&#8166;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;white-ness&rdquo; neut. <i>e.g.</i> <span class="grk" title="leukos">&#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;white,&rdquo; Lat.
<i>l&#363;ce&#333;</i>.</p>

<p><i>t&#275;lum</i> from *<i>t&#275;ns-lom</i> or *<i>tends-lom</i>, <i>tr&#257;n&#257;re</i> from *<i>tr&#257;ns-n&#257;re</i>.</p>

<p><i>s&#275;vir&#299;</i> from *<i>sex-vir&#299;</i>, <i>&#275;veh&#333;</i> from *<i>ex-veh&#333;</i>, and so <i>&#275;-mitt&#333;</i>, <i>&#275;-l&#299;d&#333;</i>,
<i>&#275;-numer&#333;</i>, and from these forms arose the proposition <i>&#275;</i>
instead of <i>ex</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>(v.) Similarly -<i>sd</i>- became -<i>d</i>-, as in <i>&#299;dem</i> from <i>is-dem</i>.</p>

<p>(vi.) Before <i>n</i>-, <i>m</i>-, <i>l</i>-, initially <i>s</i>- disappeared, as in <i>n&#363;bo</i> beside
Old Church Slavonic <i>snubiti</i>, &ldquo;to love, pay court to&rdquo;; <i>m&#299;ror</i> beside
Sans, <i>sm√°yat&#275;</i>, &ldquo;laughs,&rdquo; Eng. <i>smi-le</i>; <i>l&#363;bricus</i> beside Goth, <i>sliupan</i>,
Eng. <i>slip</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Latin -<i>ss</i>- arose from an original -<i>t</i> + <i>t</i>-, -<i>d</i> + <i>t</i>-, -<i>dh</i> + <i>t</i>- (except
before -<i>r</i>), as in <i>missus</i>, earlier *<i>mit-tos</i>; <i>t&#333;nsus</i>, earlier *<i>tond-tos</i>, but
<i>tonstr&#299;x</i> from *<i>tond-tr&#299;x</i>. After long vowels this -<i>ss</i>- became a single -<i>s</i>- some
time before Cicero (who wrote <i>caussa</i> [see above], <i>divissio</i>,
&amp;c., but probably only pronounced them with -<i>s</i>-, since the -<i>ss</i>- came
to be written single directly after his time).</p>

<p>26. Of the Indo-European velars the breathed <i>q</i> was usually preserved
in Latin with a labial addition of -<i>&#7799;</i>- (as in <i>sequor</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="epomai">&#7957;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</span>,
Goth, <i>saihvan</i>, Eng. <i>see</i>; <i>quod</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="pod-(apos)">&#960;&#959;&#948;-(&#945;&#960;&#972;&#962;)</span>, Eng. <i>what</i>); but the
voiced &#423;<span class="f80">&#7799;</span> remained (as -<i>gu</i>-) only after -<i>n</i>- (<i>unguo</i> beside Ir. <i>imb</i>,
&ldquo;butter&rdquo;) and (as <i>g</i>) before <i>r</i>, <i>l</i>, and <i>u</i> (as in <i>gravis</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="barys">&#946;&#945;&#961;&#973;&#962;</span>; <i>glans</i>,
Gr. <span class="grk" title="balanos">&#946;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>; <i>leg&#363;men</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="lobos">&#955;&#959;&#946;&#972;&#962;</span>, <span class="grk" title="lebinthos">&#955;&#949;&#946;&#943;&#957;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>). Elsewhere it became <i>v</i>,
as in <i>veni&#333;</i> (see ¬ß 23, ii.), <i>n&#363;dus</i> from *<i>novedos</i>, Eng. <i>naked</i>. Hence
<i>b&#333;s</i> (Sans. <i>g&#257;us</i>, Eng. <i>cow</i>) must be regarded as a farmer&rsquo;s word
borrowed from one of the country dialects (<i>e.g.</i> Sabine); the pure
Latin would be *<i>v&#333;s</i>, and its oblique cases, <i>e.g.</i> acc. *<i>vovem</i>, would be
inconveniently close in sound to the word for sheep <i>ovem</i>.</p>

<p>27. The treatment of the Indo-European voiced aspirates (<i>bh</i>,
<i>dh</i>, <i>&#7713;h</i> <i>&#423;h</i>) in Latin is one of the most marked characteristics of the
language, which separates it from all the other Italic dialects, since
the fricative sounds, which represented the Indo-European aspirates
in pro-ethnic Italic, remained fricatives medially if they remained at
all in that position in Oscan and Umbrian, whereas in Latin they
were nearly always changed into voiced explosives. Thus&mdash;</p>

<p>28. <span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;This summary account of the chief points in
Latin phonology may serve as an introduction to its principles, and
give some insight into the phonetic character of the language. For
systematic study reference must be made to the standard books,
Karl Brugmann, <i>Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der Indo-Germanischen
Sprachen</i> (vol. i., <i>Lautlehre</i>, 2nd ed. Strassburg,
1897; Eng. trans. of ed. 1 by Joseph Wright, Strassburg, 1888) and
his <i>Kurze vergleichende Grammatik</i> (Strassburg, 1902); these contain
still by far the best accounts of Latin; Max Niederman, <i>Pr√©cis de
phon√©tique du Latin</i> (Paris, 1906), a very convenient handbook,
excellently planned; F. Sommer, <i>Lateinische Laut- und Flexionslehre</i>
(Heidelberg, 1902), containing many new conjectures; W. M.
Lindsay, <i>The Latin Language</i> (Oxford, 1894), translated into German
(with corrections) by Nohl (Leipzig, 1897), a most valuable collection
of material, especially from the ancient grammarians, but not always
accurate in phonology; F. Stolz, vol. i. of a joint <i>Historische Grammatik
d. lat. Sprache</i> by Blase, Landgraf, Stolz and others (Leipzig,
1894); Neue-Wagener, <i>Formenlehre d. lat. Sprache</i> (3 vols., 3rd ed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span>
Leipzig, 1888, foll.); H. J. Roby&rsquo;s <i>Latin Grammar</i> (from Plautus
to Suetonius; London, 7th ed., 1896) contains a masterly collection
of material, especially in morphology, which is still of great value.
W. G. Hale and C. D. Buck&rsquo;s <i>Latin Grammar</i> (Boston, 1903), though
on a smaller scale, is of very great importance, as it contains the
fruit of much independent research on the part of both authors; in
the difficult questions of orthography it was, as late as 1907, the only
safe guide.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">II. Morphology</span></p>

<p>In morphology the following are the most characteristic Latin
innovations:&mdash;</p>

<p>29. <i>In nouns.</i></p>

<p>(i.) The complete loss of the dual number, save for a survival in
the dialect of Praeneste (<i>C.I.L.</i> xiv. 2891, = Conway, <i>Ital. Dial.</i> p. 285,
where <i>Q. k. Cestio Q. f.</i> seems to be nom. dual); so <i>C.I.L.</i> xi. 6706<span class="su">5</span>,
T. C. Vomanio, see W. Schulze, <i>Lat. Eigennamen</i>, p. 117.</p>

<p>(ii.) The introduction of new forms in the gen. sing, of the -<i>o</i>- stems
(<i>domin&#299;</i>), of the -<i>&#257;</i>- stems (<i>m&#275;nsae</i>) and in the nom. plural of the
same two declensions; innovations mostly derived from the pronominal
declension.</p>

<p>(iii.) The development of an adverbial formation out of what was
either an instrumental or a locative of the -<i>o</i>- stems, as in <i>long&#275;</i>.
And here may be added the other adverbial developments, in -<i>m</i>
(<i>palam</i>, <i>sensim</i>) probably accusative, and -<i>iter</i>, which is simply the
accusative of <i>iter</i>, &ldquo;way,&rdquo; crystallized, as is shown especially
by the fact that though in the end it attached itself particularly to
adjectives of the third declension (<i>molliter</i>), it appears also from
adjectives of the second declension whose meaning made their combination
with <i>iter</i> especially natural, such as <i>longiter</i>, <i>firmiter</i>, <i>largiter</i>
(cf. English <i>straightway</i>, <i>longways</i>). The only objections to this
derivation which had any real weight (see F. Skutsch, <i>De nominibus
no- suffixi ope formatis</i>, 1890, pp. 4-7) have been removed by
Exon&rsquo;s Law (¬ß 11), which supplies a clear reason why the contracted
type <i>constanter</i> arose in and was felt to be proper to Participial
adverbs, while <i>firmiter</i> and the like set the type for those formed
from adjectives.</p>

<p>(iv.) The development of the so-called fifth declension by a re-adjustment
of the declension of the nouns formed with the suffix -<i>i&#275;</i>-:
<i>ia</i>- (which appears, for instance, in all the Greek feminine participles,
and in a more abstract sense in words like <i>m&#257;teri&#275;s</i>) to match the
inflexion of two old root-nouns <i>r&#275;s</i> and <i>di&#275;s</i>, the stems of which were
originally <i>r&#275;&#7725;</i>- (Sans. <i>r&#257;s</i>, <i>r&#257;yas</i>, cf. Lat. <i>reor</i>) and
<i>di&#275;&#7799;</i>-.</p>

<p>(v.) The disuse of the -<i>ti</i>- suffix in an abstract sense. The great
number of nouns which Latin inherited formed with this suffix were
either (1) marked as abstract by the addition of the further suffix
-<i>&#333;n</i>- (as in <i>natio</i> beside the Gr. <span class="grk" title="gn√™si-os">&#947;&#957;&#8052;&#963;&#953;-&#959;&#962;</span>, &amp;c.) or else (2) confined to a
concrete sense; thus <i>vectis</i>, properly &ldquo;a carrying, lifting,&rdquo; came to
mean &ldquo;pole, lever&rdquo;; <i>ratis</i>, properly a &ldquo;reckoning, devising,&rdquo; came
to mean &ldquo;an (improvised) raft&rdquo; (contrast <i>rati&#333;</i>); <i>postis</i>, a &ldquo;placing,&rdquo;
came to mean &ldquo;post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(vi.) The confusion of the consonantal stems with stems ending in
-<i>&#301;</i>-. This was probably due very largely to the forms assumed
through phonetic changes by the gen. sing. and the nom. and acc.
plural. Thus at say 300 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the inflexions probably were:</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcc">conson. stem</td> <td class="tcc">-<i>&#301;</i>- stem</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Nom. plur.</td> <td class="tcl">*<i>r&#275;g-&#277;s</i></td> <td class="tcl"><i>host-&#275;s</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Acc. plur.</td> <td class="tcl"><i>r&#277;g-&#275;s</i></td> <td class="tcl"><i>host-&#299;s</i></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The confusing difference of signification of the long -<i>&#275;s</i> ending led
to a levelling of these and other forms in the two paradigms.</p>

<p>(vii.) The disuse of the <i>u</i> declension (Gr. <span class="grk" title="h√™dys">&#7969;&#948;&#973;&#962;</span>, <span class="grk" title="stachys">&#963;&#964;&#940;&#967;&#965;&#962;</span>) in adjectives;
this group in Latin, thanks to its feminine form (Sans. fem.
<i>sv&#257;dv&#299;</i>, &ldquo;sweet&rdquo;), was transferred to the <i>i</i> declension (<i>suavis</i>, <i>gravis</i>,
<i>levis</i>, <i>dulcis</i>).</p>

<p>30. <i>In verbs.</i></p>

<p>(i.) The disuse of the distinction between the personal endings of
primary and secondary tenses, the -<i>t</i> and -<i>nt</i>, for instance, being used
for the third person singular and plural respectively in all tenses and
moods of the active. This change was completed after the archaic
period, since we find in the oldest inscriptions -<i>d</i> regularly used in the
third person singular of past tenses, <i>e.g.</i> <i>deded</i>, <i>feced</i> in place of the
later <i>dedit</i>, <i>fecit</i>; and since in Oscan the distinction was preserved to
the end, both in singular and plural, <i>e.g.</i> <i>faamat</i> (perhaps meaning
&ldquo;auctionatur&rdquo;), but <i>deded</i> (&ldquo;dedit&rdquo;). It is commonly assumed from
the evidence of Greek and Sanskrit (Gr. <span class="grk" title="hesti">&#7957;&#963;&#964;&#953;</span>, Sans. <i>asti</i> beside Lat.
est) that the primary endings in Latin have lost a final -<i>i</i>, partly or
wholly by some phonetic change.</p>

<p>(ii.) The non-thematic conjugation is almost wholly lost, surviving
only in a few forms of very common use, <i>est</i>, &ldquo;is&rdquo;; <i>&#275;st</i>,
&ldquo;eats&rdquo;; <i>volt</i>, &ldquo;wills,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>(iii.) The complete fusion of the aorist and perfect forms, and in
the same tense the fusion of active and middle endings; thus
<i>tutud&#299;</i>, earlier *<i>tutudai</i>, is a true middle perfect; <i>d&#299;x&#299;</i> is an <i>s</i> aorist with
the same ending attached; <i>d&#299;xit</i> is an aorist active; <i>tutudisti</i> is a
conflation of perfect and aorist with a middle personal ending.</p>

<p>(iv.) The development of perfects in -<i>u&#299;</i> and -<i>v&#299;</i>, derived partly
from true perfects of roots ending in <i>v</i> or <i>u</i>, <i>e.g.</i> <i>m&#333;v&#299;</i> <i>ru&#299;</i>. For the
origin of <i>monu&#299;</i> see Exon, <i>Hermathena</i> (1901), xi. 396 sq.</p>

<p>(v.) The complete fusion of conjunctive and optative into a single
mood, the subjunctive; <i>regam</i>, &amp;c., are conjunctive forms, whereas
<i>rexerim</i>, <i>rexissem</i> are certainly and <i>regerem</i> most probably optative;
the origin of <i>amem</i> and the like is still doubtful. Notice, however,
that true conjunctive forms were often used as futures, <i>reg&#275;s</i>, <i>reget</i>,
&amp;c., and also the simple thematic conjunctive in forms like <i>er&#333;</i>,
<i>rexer&#333;</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(vi.) The development of the future in -<i>bo</i> and imperfect in -<i>bam</i>
by compounding some form of the verb, possibly the Present
Participle with forms from the root of <i>fu&#299;</i>, *<i>amans-fuo</i> becoming
<i>amab&#333;</i>, *<i>amans-f&#7799;&#257;m</i> becoming <i>am&#257;bam</i> at a very early period of
Latin; see F. Skutsch, <i>Atti d. Congresso Storico Intern.</i> (1903),
vol. ii. p. 191.</p>

<p>(vii.) We have already noticed the rise of the passive in -<i>r</i> (¬ß 5 (<i>d</i>)).
Observe, however, that several middle forms have been pressed into
the service, partly because the -<i>r</i>- in them which had come from -<i>s</i>-
seemed to give them a passive colour (<i>legere</i> = Gr. <span class="grk" title="lege(s)o">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;(&#963;)&#959;</span>, Attic
<span class="grk" title="legou">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#965;</span>). The interesting forms in -<i>min&#299;</i> are a confusion of two distinct
inflexions, namely, an old infinitive in -<i>menai</i>, used for the imperative,
and the participial -<i>menoi</i>, masculine, -<i>menai</i>, feminine, used with
the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; in place of the ordinary inflexions. Since these
forms had all come to have the same shape, through phonetic change,
their meanings were fused; the imperative forms being restricted
to the plural, and the participial forms being restricted to the second
person.</p>

<p>31. <i>Past Participle Passive.</i>&mdash;Next should be mentioned the great
development in the use of the participle in -<i>tos</i> (<i>factus</i>, <i>fusus</i>, &amp;c.).
This participle was taken with <i>sum</i> to form the perfect tenses of the
passive, in which, thanks partly to the fusion of perfect and aorist
active, a past aorist sense was also evolved. This reacted on the
participle itself giving it a prevailingly past colour, but its originally
timeless use survives in many places, <i>e.g.</i> in the participle <i>ratus</i>,
which has as a rule no past sense, and more definitely still in such
passages as Vergil, <i>Georg.</i> i. 206 (<i>vectis</i>), <i>Aen.</i> vi. 22 (<i>ductis</i>), both of
which passages demand a present sense. It is to be noticed also that
in the earliest Latin, as in Greek and Sanskrit, the <i>passive</i> meaning,
though the commonest, is not universal. Many traces of this survive
in classical Latin, of which the chief are</p>

<div class="list1">
<p>1. The active meaning of deponent participles, in spite of the
fact that some of them (<i>e.g.</i> <i>adeptus</i>, <i>&#275;m&#275;nsus</i>, <i>expertus</i>) have
also a passive sense, and</p>

<p>2. The familiar use of these participles by the Augustan poets
with an accusative attached (<i>galeam indutus</i>, <i>traiectus lora</i>).
Here no doubt the use of the Greek middle influenced the
Latin poets, but no doubt they thought also that they were
reviving an old Latin idiom.</p>
</div>

<p>32. <i>Future Participle.</i>&mdash;Finally may be mentioned together (<i>a</i>) the
development of the future participle active (in -<i>&#363;rus</i>, never so freely
used as the other participles, being rare in the ablative absolute even
in Tacitus) from an old infinitive in -<i>&#363;rum</i> (&ldquo;scio inimicos meos
hoc dicturum,&rdquo; C. Gracchus (and others) <i>apud</i> Gell. 1. 7, and Priscian
ix. 864 (p. 475 Keil), which arose from combining the dative or
locative of the verbal noun in -<i>tu</i> with an old infinitive <i>esom</i> &ldquo;esse&rdquo;
which survives in Oscan, *<i>dictu esom</i> becoming <i>dicturum</i>. This was
discovered by J. P. Postgate (<i>Class. Review</i>, v. 301, and <i>Idg.
Forschungen</i> iv. 252). (<i>b</i>) From the same infinitival accusative with
the post-position -<i>d&#333;</i>, meaning &ldquo;to,&rdquo; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; &ldquo;in&rdquo; (cf. <i>quand&#333;</i> for
*<i>quam-do</i>, and Eng. <i>to</i>, Germ, <i>zu</i>) was formed the so-called gerund
<i>agen-d&#333;</i>, &ldquo;for doing,&rdquo; &ldquo;in doing,&rdquo; which was taken for a Case, and
so gave rise to the accusative and genitive in -<i>dum</i> and -<i>d&#299;</i>. The form
in -d&#333; still lives in Italian as an indeclinable present participle. The
modal and purposive meanings of -<i>d&#333;</i> appear in the uses of the gerund.</p>

<p>The authorities giving a fuller account of Latin morphology are the
same as those cited in ¬ß 28 above, save that the reader must consult
the second volume of Brugmann&rsquo;s <i>Grundriss</i>, which in the English
translation (by Conway and Rouse, Strassburg, 1890-1896) is
divided into volumes ii, iii. and iv.; and that Niedermann does not
deal with morphology.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">III. <span class="sc">Syntax</span></p>

<p>The chief innovations of syntax developed in Latin may now be
briefly noted.</p>

<p>33. <i>In nouns.</i></p>

<p>(i.) Latin restricted the various Cases to more sharply defined uses
than either Greek or Sanskrit; the free use of the internal accusative
in Greek (<i>e.g.</i> <span class="grk" title="habron bainein, tuphlos ta √¥ta">&#7937;&#946;&#961;&#8056;&#957; &#946;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957;, &#964;&#965;&#966;&#955;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8048; &#8038;&#964;&#945;</span>) is strange to Latin, save in
poetical imitations of Greek; and so is the freedom of the Sanskrit
instrumental, which often covers meanings expressed in Latin by
<i>cum</i>, <i>ab</i>, <i>inter</i>.</p>

<p>(ii.) The syncretism of the so-called ablative case, which combines
the uses of (<i>a</i>) the true ablative which ended in -<i>d</i> (O. Lat. <i>praid&#257;d</i>);
(<i>b</i>) the instrumental sociative (plural forms like <i>domin&#299;s</i>, the ending
being that of Sans. <i>√ßiv&#257;i&#351;</i>); and (<i>c</i>) the locative (<i>noct-e</i>, &ldquo;at night&rdquo;;
<i>itiner-e</i>, &ldquo;on the road,&rdquo; with the ending of Greek <span class="grk" title="elpid-i">&#7952;&#955;&#960;&#943;&#948;-&#953;</span>). The so-called
absolute construction is mainly derived from the second of
these, since it is regularly attached fairly closely to the subject of the
clause in which it stands, and when accompanied by a passive
participle most commonly denotes an action performed by that
subject. But the other two sources cannot be altogether excluded
(<i>orto sole</i>, &ldquo;starting from sunrise&rdquo;; <i>campo patente</i>, &ldquo;on, in sight of,
the open plain&rdquo;).</p>

<p>34. <i>In verbs.</i></p>

<p>(i.) The rich development and fine discrimination of the uses of
the subjunctive mood, especially (<i>a</i>) in indirect questions (based on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>
direct deliberative questions and not fully developed by the time
of Plautus, who constantly writes such phrases as <i>dic quis es</i> for the
Ciceronian <i>dic quis sis</i>); (<i>b</i>) after the relative of essential definition
(<i>non is sum qui negem</i>) and the circumstantial <i>cum</i> (&ldquo;at such a time
as that&rdquo;). The two uses (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) with (<i>c</i>) the common Purpose
and Consequence-clauses spring from the &ldquo;prospective&rdquo; or &ldquo;anticipatory&rdquo;
meaning of the mood. (<i>d</i>) Observe further its use in subordinate
oblique clauses (<i>irascitur quod abierim</i>, &ldquo;he is angry because,
<i>as he asserts</i>, I went away&rdquo;). This and all the uses of the mood in
oratio obliqua are derived partly from (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) and partly from
the (<i>e</i>) Unreal Jussive of past time (<i>Non illi argentum redderem?
Non redderes</i>, &ldquo;Ought I not to have returned the money to him?&rdquo;

<p class="pt2 center">IV. <span class="sc">Importation of Greek Words</span></p>

<p>36. It is convenient, before proceeding to describe the development
of the language in its various epochs, to notice briefly
the debt of its vocabulary to Greek, since it affords an indication
of the steadily increasing influence of Greek life and literature
upon the growth of the younger idiom. Corssen (<i>Lat. Aussprache</i>,
ii. 814) pointed out four different stages in the process,
and though they are by no means sharply divided in time,
they do correspond to different degrees and kinds of intercourse.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(<i>a</i>) The first represents the period of the early intercourse of Rome
with the Greek states, especially with the colonies in the south of
Italy and Sicily. To this stage belong many names of nations,
countries and towns, as <i>Siculi</i>, <i>Tarentum</i>, <i>Graeci</i>, <i>Achivi</i>, <i>Poenus</i>;
and also names of weights and measures, articles of industry and
terms connected with navigation, as <i>mina</i>, <i>talentum</i>, <i>purpura</i>,
<i>patina</i>, <i>ancora</i>, <i>aplustre</i>, <i>nausea</i>. Words like <i>amurca</i>, <i>scutula</i>,
<i>pessulus</i>, <i>balineum</i>, <i>tarpessita</i> represent familiarity with Greek
customs and bear equally the mark of naturalization. To these
may be added names of gods or heroes, like <i>Apollo</i>, <i>Pollux</i> and
perhaps <i>Hercules</i>. These all became naturalized Latin words and
were modified by the phonetic changes which took place in the Latin
language after they had come into it (cf. ¬ß¬ß 9-27 <i>supra</i>). (<i>b</i>) The
second stage was probably the result of the closer intercourse resulting
from the conquest of southern Italy, and the wars in Sicily,
and of the contemporary introduction of imitations of Greek literature
into Rome, with its numerous references to Greek life and
culture. It is marked by the free use of hybrid forms, whether made
by the addition of Latin suffixes to Greek stems as <i>ballist&#257;rius</i>,
<i>h&#275;pat&#257;rius</i>, <i>subbasilic&#257;nus</i>, <i>s<span class="ov">y</span>cophanti&#333;sus</i>, <i>c&#333;miss&#257;r&#299;</i> or of Greek
suffixes to Latin stems as <i>pl&#257;gipatidas</i>, <i>pern&#333;nides</i>; or by derivation,
as <i>thermop&#333;t&#257;re</i>, <i>supparas&#299;t&#257;ri</i>; or by composition as <i>ineusch&#275;m&#275;</i>,
<i>thyrsigerae</i>, <i>flagritribae</i>, <i>scrophipasc&#299;</i>. The character of many of
these words shows that the comic poets who coined them must have
been able to calculate upon a fair knowledge of colloquial Greek on
the part of a considerable portion of their audience. The most
remarkable instance of this is supplied by the burlesque lines in
Plautus (<i>Pers.</i> 702 seq.), where Sagaristio describes himself as</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>Vaniloquidorus, Virginisvendonides,</p>
<p>Nugipiloquides, Argentumexterebronides,</p>
<p>Tedigniloquides, Nummosexpalponides,</p>
<p>Quodsemelarripides, Nunquameripides.</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">During this period Greek words are still generally inflected according
to the Latin usage.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) But with Accius (see below) begins a third stage, in which the
Greek inflexion is frequently preserved, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Hectora</i>, <i>Oresten</i>, <i>Cithaeron</i>;
and from this time forward the practice wavers. Cicero
generally prefers the Latin case-endings, defending, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Piraeeum</i> as
against <i>Piraeea</i> (<i>ad Att.</i> vii. 3, 7), but not without some fluctuation,
while Varro takes the opposite side, and prefers <i>po√´masin</i> to the
Ciceronian <i>po√´matis</i>. By this time also <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> were introduced, and
the representation of the Greek aspirates by <i>th</i>, <i>ph</i>, <i>ch</i>, so that words
newly borrowed from the Greek could be more faithfully reproduced.
This is equally true whatever was the precise nature of the sound
which at that period the Greek aspirates had reached in their secular
process of change from pure aspirates (as in Eng. <i>ant-hill</i>, &amp;c.) to
fricatives (like Eng. <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i>). (See Arnold and Conway, <i>The
Restored Pronunciation of Greek and Latin</i>, 4th ed., Cambridge,
1908, p. 21.)</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) A fourth stage is marked by the practice of the Augustan
poets, who, especially when writing in imitation of Greek originals,
freely use the Greek inflexions, such as <i>Arcad&#283;s</i>, <i>Teth&#375;</i>, <i>Aegida</i>,
<i>Ech&#363;s</i>, &amp;c. Horace probably always used the Latin form in his
<i>Satires</i> and <i>Epistles</i>, the Greek in his Odes. Later prose writers for
the most part followed the example of his <i>Odes</i>. It must be added,
however, in regard to these literary borrowings that it is not quite
clear whether in this fourth class, and even in the unmodified forms
in the preceding class, the words had really any living use in
spoken Latin.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">V. Pronunciation</span></p>

<p>This appears the proper place for a rapid survey of the pronunciation<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
of the Latin language, as spoken in its best days.</p>

<p>37. <span class="sc">Consonants.</span>&mdash;(i.) <i>Back palatal.</i> Breathed plosive <i>c</i>, pronounced
always as <i>k</i> (except that in some early inscriptions&mdash;probably
none much later, if at all later, than 300 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>&mdash;the character
is used also for <i>g</i>) until about the 7th century after Christ. <i>K</i>
went out of use at an early period, except in a few old abbreviations
for words in which it had stood before <i>a</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>kal.</i> for <i>kalendae</i>. <i>Q</i>,
always followed by the consonantal <i>u</i>, except in a few old inscriptions,
in which it is used for <i>c</i> before the vowel <i>u</i>, <i>e.g.</i> <i>pequnia</i>. <i>X</i>,
an abbreviation for <i>cs</i>; <i>xs</i> is, however, sometimes found. Voiced
plosive <i>g</i>, pronounced as in English <i>gone</i>, but never as in English
<i>gem</i> before about the 6th century after Christ. Aspirate <i>h</i>, the rough
breathing as in English.</p>

<p>(ii.) <i>Palatal.</i>&mdash;The consonantal <i>i</i>, like the English <i>y</i>; it is only
in late inscriptions that we find, in spellings like <i>Zanuario</i>, <i>Giove</i>,
any definite indication of a pronunciation like the English <i>j</i>. The
precise date of the change is difficult to determine (see Lindsay&rsquo;s
<i>Latin Lang.</i> p. 49), especially as we may, in isolated cases, have before
us merely a dialectic variation; see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paeligni</a></span>.</p>

<p>(iii.) <i>Lingual.</i>&mdash;<i>r</i> as in English, but probably produced more
with the point of the tongue. <i>l</i> similarly more dental than in
English. <i>s</i> always breathed (as Eng. <i>ce</i> in <i>ice</i>). <i>z</i>, which is only
found in the transcription of Greek words in and after the time of
Cicero, as <i>dz</i> or <i>zz</i>.</p>

<p>(iv.) <i>Dental.</i>&mdash;Breathed, <i>t</i> as in English. Voiced, <i>d</i> as in
English; but by the end of the 4th century <i>di</i> before a vowel was
pronounced like our <i>j</i> (cf. <i>diurnal</i> and <i>journal</i>). Nasal, <i>n</i> as in
English; but also (like the English <i>n</i>) a guttural nasal (<i>ng</i>) before a
guttural. Apparently it was very lightly pronounced, and easily
fell away before <i>s</i>.</p>

<p>(v.) <i>Labial.</i>&mdash;Breathed, <i>p</i> as in English. Voiced, <i>b</i> as in
English; but occasionally in inscriptions of the later empire <i>v</i> is
written for <i>b</i>, showing that in some cases <i>b</i> had already acquired the
fricative sound of the contemporary &beta; (see ¬ß 24, iii.). <i>b</i> before a
sharp <i>s</i> was pronounced <i>p</i>, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>urbs</i>. Nasal, <i>m</i> as in English,
but very slightly pronounced at the end of a word. Spirant,
<i>v</i> like the <i>ou</i> in French <i>oui</i>, but later approximating to the <i>w</i> heard
in some parts of Germany, Ed. Sievers, <i>Grundz√ºge d. Phonetik</i>, ed. 4,
p. 117, <i>i.e.</i> a labial <i>v</i>, not (like the English <i>v</i>) a labio-dental <i>v</i>.</p>

<p>(vi.) <i>Labio-dental.</i>&mdash;Breathed fricative, <i>f</i> as in English.</p>

<p>38. <span class="sc">Vowels.</span>&mdash;<i>&#257;</i>, <i>&#363;</i>, <i>&#299;</i>, as the English <i>ah</i>, oo, <i>ee</i>; <i>&#333;</i>, a sound coming
nearer to Eng. <i>aw</i> than to Eng. <i>&#333;</i>; <i>&#275;</i> a close Italian <i>&#275;</i>, nearly as the <i>a</i> of
Eng. <i>mate</i>, <i>√©e</i> of Fr. <i>pass√©e</i>. The short sound of the vowels was not
always identical in quality with the long sound. <i>&#259;</i> was pronounced
as in the French <i>chatte</i>, <i>&#365;</i> nearly as in Eng. <i>pull</i>, <i>&#301;</i> nearly as in <i>pit</i>, <i>&#335;</i>
as in <i>dot</i>, <i>&#277;</i> nearly as in <i>pet</i>. The diphthongs were produced by pronouncing
in rapid succession the vowels of which they were composed,
according to the above scheme. This gives, <i>au</i> somewhat
broader than <i>ou</i> in house; <i>eu</i> like <i>ow</i> in the &ldquo;Yankee&rdquo; pronunciation
of <i>town</i>; <i>ae</i> like the vowel in <i>hat</i> lengthened, with perhaps somewhat
more approximation to the <i>i</i> in <i>wine</i>; <i>oe</i>, a diphthongal sound
approximating to Eng. <i>oi</i>; <i>ui</i>, as the French <i>oui</i>.</p>

<p>To this it should be added that the Classical Association, acting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>
on the advice of a committee of Latin scholars, has recommended
for the diphthongs <i>ae</i> and <i>oe</i> the pronunciation of English <i>i</i> (really <i>ai</i>)
in <i>wine</i> and <i>oi</i> in <i>boil</i>, sounds which they undoubtedly had in the
time of Plautus and probably much later, and which for practical
use in teaching have been proved far the best.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt2 center">VI. <span class="sc">The Language As Recorded</span></p>

<p>39. Passing now to a survey of the condition of the language
at various epochs and in the different authors, we find the
earliest monument of it yet discovered in a donative inscription
on a fibula or brooch found in a tomb of the 7th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
at Praeneste. It runs &ldquo;Manios med fhefhaked Numasioi,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;Manios made me for Numasios.&rdquo; The use of <i>f</i> (<i>fh</i>) to denote
the sound of Latin <i>f</i> supplied the explanation of the change of
the symbol <i>f</i> from its Greek value (= Eng. <i>w</i>) to its Latin value
<i>f</i>, and shows the Chalcidian Greek alphabet in process of adaptation
to the needs of Latin (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Writing</a></span>). The reduplicated
perfect, its 3rd sing. ending -<i>ed</i>, the dative masculine in -<i>oi</i>
(this is one of the only two recorded examples in Latin), the
-<i>s</i>- between vowels (¬ß 25, 1), and the -<i>a</i>- in what was then (see
¬ß¬ß 9, 10) certainly an unaccented syllable and the accusative
<i>med</i>, are all interesting marks of antiquity.<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>40. The next oldest fragment of continuous Latin is furnished
by a vessel dug up in the valley between the Quirinal and the
Viminal early in 1880. The vessel is of a dark brown clay, and
consists of three small round pots, the sides of which are connected
together. All round this vessel runs an inscription,
in three clauses, two nearly continuous, the third written below;
the writing is from right to left, and is still clearly legible; the
characters include one sign not belonging to the later Latin
alphabet, namely <img style="width:15px; height:17px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img251a.jpg" alt="" /> for R, while the M has five strokes and the
Q has the form of a Koppa.</p>

<p>The inscription is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;iovesat deivos qoi med mitat, nei ted endo cosmis virco sied, asted
noisi opetoitesiai pacari vois.</p>

<p>dvenos med feced en manom einom duenoi ne med malo statod.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The general style of the writing and the phonetic peculiarities
make it fairly certain that this work must have been produced
not later than 300 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Some points in its interpretation are
still open to doubt,<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a> but the probable interpretation is&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Deos iurat ille (<i>or</i> iurant illi) qui me mittat (<i>or</i> mittant) ne in te
Virgo (<i>i.e.</i> Proserpina) comis sit, nisi quidem optimo (?) Theseae (?)
pacari vis. Duenos me fecit contra Manum, Dueno autem ne per me
malum stato (= imputetur, imponatur).&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;He (or they) who dispatch me binds the gods (by his offering)
that Proserpine shall not be kind to thee unless thou wilt
make terms with (or &ldquo;for&rdquo;) Opetos Thesias (?). Duenos
made me against Manus, but let no evil fall to Duenos on my
account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>41. Between these two inscriptions lies in point of date the
famous stele discovered in the Forum in 1899 (G. Boni, <i>Notiz.
d. scavi</i>, May 1899). The upper half had been cut off in order
to make way for a new pavement or black stone blocks (known
to archaeologists as the <i>niger lapis</i>) on the site of the comitium,
just to the north-east of the Forum in front of the Senate House.
The inscription was written lengthwise along the (pyramidal)
stele from foot to apex, but with the alternate lines in reverse
directions, and one line not on the full face of any one of the four
sides, but up a roughly-flattened fifth side made by slightly
broadening one of the angles. No single sentence is complete
and the mutilated fragments have given rise to a whole literature
of conjectural &ldquo;restorations.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>R. S. Conway examined it <i>in situ</i> in company with F. Skutsch in
1903 (cf. his article in Vollm√∂ller&rsquo;s <i>Jahresbericht</i>, vi. 453), and the
only words that can be regarded as reasonably certain are <i>regei</i>
(<i>regi</i>) on face 2, <i>kalatorem</i> and <i>iouxmenta</i> on face 3, and <i>iouestod</i>
(<i>iusto</i>) on face 4.<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a> The date may be said to be fixed by the variation of
the sign for <i>m</i> between <img style="width:26px; height:16px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img251b.jpg" alt="" /> and <img style="width:26px; height:18px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img251c.jpg" alt="" /> (with <img style="width:11px; height:12px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img251d.jpg" alt="" /> for <i>r</i>) and other alphabetic
indications which suggest the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> It has been suggested
also that the reason for the destruction of the stele and the repavement
may have been either (1) the pollution of the comitium by the
Gallic invasion of 390 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, all traces of which, on their departure,
could be best removed by a repaving; or (2) perhaps more probably,
the Augustan restorations (Studniczka, <i>Jahresheft d. √ñsterr. Institut</i>,
1903, vi. 129 ff.).</p>
<div class="author">(R. S. C.)</div>

<p>42. Of the earlier long inscriptions the most important would be
the <i>Columna Rostrata</i>, or column of Gaius Duilius (<i>q.v.</i>), erected to
commemorate his victory over the Carthaginians in 260 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, but for
the extent to which it has suffered from the hands of restorers.
The shape of the letters plainly shows that the inscription, as we
have it, was cut in the time of the empire. Hence Ritschl and
Mommsen pointed out that the language was modified at the same
time, and that, although many archaisms have been retained, some
were falsely introduced, and others replaced by more modern forms.
The most noteworthy features in it are&mdash;C always written for G
(<span class="sc">Ceset</span> = <i>gessit</i>), single for double consonants (<i>clases-classes</i>), <i>d</i>
retained in the ablative (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>in altod marid</i>), <i>o</i> for <i>u</i> in inflexions
(<i>primos</i>, <i>exfociont</i> = <i>exfugiunt</i>), <i>e</i> for <i>i</i> (<i>navebos</i> = <i>navibus</i>, <i>exemet</i> =
<i>exemit</i>); of these the first is probably an affected archaism, G
having been introduced some time before the assumed date of the
inscription. On the other hand, we have <i>praeda</i> where we should
have expected <i>praida</i>; no final consonants are dropped; and the
forms -<i>es</i>, -<i>eis</i> and -<i>is</i> for the accusative plural are interchanged
capriciously. The doubts hence arising preclude the possibility of
using it with confidence as evidence for the state of the language in
the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p>43. Of unquestionable genuineness and the greatest value are the
<i>Scipionum Elogia</i>, inscribed on stone coffins, found in the monument
of the Scipios outside the Capene gate (<i>C.I.L.</i><span class="sp">1</span> i. 32). The earliest
of the family whose epitaph has been preserved is L. Cornelius Scipio
Barbatus (consul 298 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the latest C. Cornelius Scipio Hispanus
(praetor in 139 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>); but there are good reasons for believing with
Ritschl that the epitaph of the first was not contemporary, but was
somewhat later than that of his son (consul 259 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). This last may
therefore be taken as the earliest specimen of any length of Latin
and it was written at Rome; it runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>honcoino . ploirume . cosentiont . r[<i>omai</i>]</p>

<p><i>de</i>]det . tempestatebus . aide . mereto[<i>d votam</i>].</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">The archaisms in this inscription are&mdash;(1) the retention of <i>o</i> for <i>u</i>
in the inflexion of both nouns and verbs; (2) the diphthongs <i>oi</i>
(= later <i>u</i>) and <i>ai</i> (= later <i>ae</i>); (3) -<i>et</i> for -<i>it</i>, <i>hec</i> for <i>hic</i>, and -<i>ebus</i>
for -<i>ibus</i>; (4) <i>duon</i>- for <i>bon</i>; and (5) the dropping of a final <i>m</i> in every
case except in <i>Luciom</i>, a variation which is a marked characteristic
of the language of this period.</p>

<p>44. The oldest specimen of the Latin language preserved to us
in any literary source is to be found in two fragments of the Carmina
Saliaria (Varro, <i>De ling. Lat.</i> vii. 26, 27), and one in Terentianus
Scaurus, but they are unfortunately so corrupt as to give us little
real information (see B. Maurenbrecher, <i>Carminum Saliarium
reliquiae</i>, Leipzig, 1894; G. Hempl, <i>American Philol. Assoc.
Transactions</i>, xxxi., 1900, 184). Rather better evidence is supplied
in the <i>Carmen Fratrum Arvalium</i>, which was found in 1778 engraved
on one of the numerous tablets recording the transactions of the
college of the Arval brothers, dug up on the site of their grove by
the Tiber, 5 m. from the city of Rome; but this also has been so
corrupted in its oral tradition that even its general meaning is by
no means clear (<i>C.I.L.</i><span class="sp">1</span> i. 28; Jordan, <i>Krit. Beitr√§ge</i>, pp. 203-211).</p>
</div>

<p>45. The text of the Twelve Tables (451-450 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), if preserved
in its integrity, would have been invaluable as a record of antique
Latin; but it is known to us only in quotations. R. Schoell,
whose edition and commentary (Leipzig, 1866) is the most
complete, notes the following traces, among others, of an archaic
syntax: (1) both the subject and the object of the verb are often
left to be understood from the context, <i>e.g.</i> <i>ni it antestamino,
igitur, em capito</i>; (2) the imperative is used even for permissions,
&ldquo;si volet, plus dato,&rdquo; &ldquo;if he choose, he may give him more&rdquo;;
(3) the subjunctive is apparently never used in conditional,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>
only in final sentences, but the future perfect is common; (4)
the connexion between sentences is of the simplest kind, and
conjunctions are rare. There are, of course, numerous isolated
archaisms of form and meaning, such as <i>calvitur</i>, <i>pacunt</i>, <i>endo</i>,
<i>escit</i>. Later and less elaborate editions are contained in <i>Fontes
Iuris Romani</i>, by Bruns-Mommsen-Gradenwitz (1892); and
P. Girard, <i>Textes de droit romain</i> (1895).</p>

<p>46. Turning now to the language of literature we may group
the Latin authors as follows:&mdash;<a name="fa5a" id="fa5a" href="#ft5a"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

<p>I. <i>Ante-Classical</i> (240-80 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>).&mdash;Naevius (? 269-204), Plautus
(254-184), Ennius (239-169), Cato the Elder (234-149), Terentius
(? 195-159), Pacuvius (220-132), Accius (170-94), Lucilius
(? 168-103).</p>

<p>II. <i>Classical&mdash;Golden Age</i> (80 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>-<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 14).&mdash;Varro (116-28),

(87-? 47), Sallust (86-34), Virgil (70-19), Horace (65-8), Propertius
(? 50- ?), Tibullus (? 54-? 18), Ovid (43 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>-<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 18),
Livy (59 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>-<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 18).</p>

<p>III. <i>Classical&mdash;Silver Age</i> (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 14-180).&mdash;Velleius (? 19 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>-?
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 31), M. Seneca (d. <i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 30), Persius (34-62), Petronius
(d. 66), Lucan (39-65), L. Seneca (d. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 65), Plinius major
(23-<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 79), Martial (40-101), Quintilian (42-118), Pliny the
Younger (61-? 113), Tacitus (? 60-? 118), Juvenal (? 47-? 138),
Suetonius (75-160), Fronto (<i>c.</i> 90-170).</p>

<p>47. <i>Naevius and Plautus.</i>&mdash;In Naevius we find archaisms
proportionally much more numerous than in Plautus, especially
in the retention of the original length of vowels, and early forms
of inflexion, such as the genitive in -<i>as</i> and the ablative in -<i>d</i>.
The number of archaic words preserved is perhaps due to the fact
that so large a proportion of his fragments have been preserved
only by the grammarians, who cited them for the express purpose
of explaining these.</p>

<p>Of the language of Plautus important features have already
been mentioned (¬ß¬ß 10-16); for its more general characteristics
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Plautus</a></span>.</p>

<p>48. <i>Ennius.</i>&mdash;The language of Ennius deserves especial study
because of the immense influence which he exerted in fixing the
literary style. He first established the rule that in hexameter
verse all vowels followed by two consonants (except in the case
of a mute and a liquid), or a double consonant, must be treated
as lengthened by position. The number of varying quantities
is also much diminished, and the elision of final -<i>m</i> becomes the
rule, though not without exceptions. On the other hand he very
commonly retains the original length of verbal terminations
(<i>ess&#275;t</i>, <i>faci&#275;t</i>) and of nominatives in <i>or</i> and <i>a</i>, and elides final
<i>s</i> before an initial consonant. In declension he never uses -<i>ae</i>
as the genitive, but -<i>ai</i> or -<i>as</i>; the older and shorter form of the
gen. plur. is -<i>um</i> in common; obsolete forms of pronouns are
used, as <i>mis</i>, <i>olli</i>, <i>sum</i> (= eum), <i>sas</i>, <i>sos</i>, <i>sapsa</i>; and in verbal
inflexion there are old forms like <i>mor&#299;mur</i> (¬ß 15), <i>f&#363;imus</i> (¬ß 17, vi.),
<i>potestur</i> (cf. ¬ß 5, iv.). Some experiments in the way of tmesis
(<i>saxo</i> cere <i>comminuit</i>-brum) and apocope (<i>divum domus altisonum</i>
cael, <i>replet te laetificum</i> gau) were happily regarded as failures,
and never came into real use. His syntax is simple and straightforward,
with the occasional pleonasms of a rude style, and conjunctions
are comparatively rare. From this time forward the
literary language of Rome parted company with the popular
dialect. Even to the classical writers Latin was in a certain
sense a dead language. Its vocabulary was not identical with
that of ordinary life. Now and again a writer would lend new
vigour to his style by phrases and constructions drawn from
homely speech. But on the whole, and in ever-increasing
measure, the language of literature was the language of the
schools, adapted to foreign models. The genuine current of
Italian speech is almost lost to view with Plautus and Terence,
and reappears clearly only in the semi-barbarous products of
the early Romance literature.</p>

<p>49. <i>Pacuvius, Accius and Lucilius.</i>&mdash;Pacuvius is noteworthy
especially for his attempt to introduce a free use of compounds
after the fashion of the Greek, which were felt in the classical
times to be unsuited to the genius of the Latin language,
Quintilian censures severely his line&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f90">Nerei repandirostrum incurvicervicum pecus.</p>

<p>Accius, though probably the greatest of the Roman tragedians,
is only preserved in comparatively unimportant fragments.
We know that he paid much attention to grammar and orthography;
and his language is much more finished than that of
Ennius. It shows no marked archaisms of form, unless the
infinitive in -<i>ier</i> is to be accounted as such.</p>

<p>Lucilius furnishes a specimen of the language of the period,
free from the restraints of tragic diction and the imitation of
Greek originals. Unfortunately the greater part of his fragments
are preserved only by a grammarian whose text is exceptionally
corrupt; but they leave no doubt as to the justice of the criticism
passed by Horace on his careless and &ldquo;muddy&rdquo; diction. The
<i>urbanitas</i> which is with one accord conceded to him by ancient
critics seems to indicate that his style was free from the taint of
provincial Latinity, and it may be regarded as reproducing the
language of educated circles in ordinary life; the numerous
Graecisms and Greek quotations with which it abounds show the
familiarity of his readers with the Greek language and literature.
Varro ascribes to him the <i>gracile genus dicendi</i>, the distinguishing
features of which were <i>venustas</i> and <i>subtilitas</i>. Hence it appears
that his numerous archaisms were regarded as in no way inconsistent
with grace and precision of diction. But it may be
remembered that Varro was himself something of an archaizer,
and also that the grammarians&rsquo; quotations may bring this aspect
too much into prominence. Lucilius shares with the comic poets
the use of many plebeian expressions, the love for diminutives,
abstract terms and words of abuse; but occasionally he borrows
from the more elevated style of Ennius forms like <i>simitu</i> (= simul),
<i>noenu</i> (= non), <i>facul</i> (= facile), and the genitive in -<i>&#257;&#299;</i>, and he
ridicules the contemporary tragedians for their <i>zetematia</i>, their
high-flown diction and <i>sesquipedalia verba</i>, which make the
characters talk &ldquo;not like men but like portents, flying winged
snakes.&rdquo; In his ninth book he discusses questions of grammar,
and gives some interesting facts as to the tendencies of the
language. For instance, when he ridicules a <i>praetor urbanus</i>
for calling himself <i>pretor</i>, we see already the intrusion of the
rustic degradation of <i>ae</i> into <i>e</i>, which afterwards became universal.
He shows a great command of technical language, and (partly
owing to the nature of the fragments) <span class="grk" title="hapax legomena">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</span> are very
numerous.</p>

<p>50. <i>Cato.</i>&mdash;The treatise of Cato the elder, <i>De re rustica</i>,
would have afforded invaluable material, but it has unfortunately
come down to us in a text greatly modernized, which is more of
interest from the point of view of literature than of language.
We find in it, however, instances of the accusative with <i>uti</i>, of
the old imperative <i>praefamino</i> and of the fut. sub. <i>servassis</i>,
<i>prohibessis</i> and such interesting subjunctive constructions as
<i>dato bubus bibant omnibus</i>, &ldquo;give all the oxen (water) to drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>51. <i>Growth of Latin Prose.</i>&mdash;It is unfortunately impossible to
trace the growth of Latin prose diction through its several stages
with the same clearness as in the case of poetry. The fragments
of the earlier Latin prose writers are too scanty for us to be
able to say with certainty when and how a formed prose style
was created. But the impulse to it was undoubtedly given in
the habitual practice of oratory. The earliest orators, like
Cato, were distinguished for strong common sense, biting wit
and vigorous language, rather than for any graces of style; and
probably personal <i>auctoritas</i> was of far more account than rhetoric
both in the law courts and in the assemblies of the people. The
first public speaker, according to Cicero, who aimed at a polished
style and elaborate periods was M. Aemilius Lepidus Porcina,
in the middle of the 2nd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span><a name="fa6a" id="fa6a" href="#ft6a"><span class="sp">6</span></a> On his model the Gracchi
and Carbo fashioned themselves, and, if we may judge from the
fragments of the orations of C. Gracchus which are preserved,
there were few traces of archaism remaining. A more perfect
example of the <i>urbanitas</i> at which good speakers aimed was
supplied by a famous speech of C. Fannius against C. Gracchus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
which Cicero considered the best oration of the time. No small
part of the <i>urbanitas</i> consisted in a correct urban pronunciation;
and the standard of this was found in the language of the women
of the upper classes, such as Laelia and Cornelia.</p>

<p>In the earliest continuous prose work which remains to us
the four books <i>De Rhetorica ad Herennium</i>, we find the language
already almost indistinguishable from that of Cicero. There has
been much discussion as to the authorship of this work, now
commonly, without very convincing reasons, ascribed to Q. Cornificius;
but, among the numerous arguments which prove that
it cannot have been the work of Cicero, none has been adduced
of any importance drawn from the character of the language.
It is worth while noticing that not only is the style in itself
perfectly finished, but the treatment of the subject of style,
<i>elocutio</i> (iv. 12. 17), shows the pains which had already been
given to the question. The writer lays down three chief requisites&mdash;(1)
<i>elegantia</i>, (2) <i>compositio</i> and (3) <i>dignitas</i>. Under
the first come <i>Latinitas</i>, a due avoidance of solecisms and barbarisms,
and <i>explanatio</i>, clearness, the employment of familiar and
appropriate expressions. The second demands a proper arrangement;
hiatus, alliteration, rhyme, the repetition or displacement
of words, and too long sentences are all to be eschewed. Dignity
depends upon the selection of language and of sentiments.</p>

<p>52. <i>Characteristics of Latin Prose.</i>&mdash;Hence we see that by the
time of Cicero Latin prose was fully developed. We may, therefore,
pause here to notice the characteristic qualities of the
language at its most perfect stage. The Latin critics were
themselves fully conscious of the broad distinction in character
between their own language and the Greek. Seneca dwells
upon the stately and dignified movement of the Latin period,
and uses for Cicero the happy epithet of <i>gradarius</i>. He allows
to the Greeks <i>gratia</i>, but claims <i>potentia</i> for his own countrymen.
Quintilian (xii. 10. 27 seq.) concedes to Greek more euphony and
variety both of vocalization and of accent; he admits that
Latin words are harsher in sound, and often less happily adapted
to the expression of varying shades of meaning. But he too
claims &ldquo;power&rdquo; as the distinguishing mark of his own language.
Feeble thought may be carried off by the exquisite harmony and
subtleness of Greek diction; his countrymen must aim at fulness
and weight of ideas if they are not to be beaten off the field.
The Greek authors are like lightly moving skiffs; the Romans
spread wider sails and are wafted by stronger breezes; hence
the deeper waters suit them. It is not that the Latin language
fails to respond to the calls made upon it. Lucretius and Cicero
concur, it is true, in complaints of the poverty of their native
language; but this was only because they had had no predecessors
in the task of adapting it to philosophic utterance;
and the long life of Latin technical terms like <i>qualitas</i>, <i>species</i>,
<i>genus</i>, <i>ratio</i>, shows how well the need was met when it arose.
H. A. J. Munro has said admirably of this very period:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;The living Latin for all the higher forms of composition, both
prose and verse, was a far nobler language than the living Greek.
During the long period of Grecian pre-eminence and literary glory,
from Homer to Demosthenes, all the manifold forms of poetry and
prose which were invented one after the other were brought to such
exquisite perfection that their beauty of form and grace of language
were never afterwards rivalled by Latin or any other people. But
hardly had Demosthenes and Aristotle ceased to live when that
Attic which had been gradually formed into such a noble instrument
of thought in the hands of Aristophanes, Euripides, Plato and the
orators, and had superseded for general use all the other dialects,
became at the same time the language of the civilized world and was
stricken with a mortal decay.... Epicurus, who was born in the
same year as Menander, writes a harsh jargon that does not deserve
to be called a style; and others of whose writings anything is left
entire or in fragments, historians and philosophers alike, Polybius,
Chrysippus, Philodemus, are little if any better. When Cicero deigns
to translate any of their sentences, see what grace and life he instils
into their clumsily expressed thoughts, how satisfying to the ear and
taste are the periods of Livy when he is putting into Latin the heavy
and uncouth clauses of Polybius! This may explain what Cicero
means when at one time he gives to Greek the preference over
Latin, at another to Latin over Greek; in reading Sophocles or
Plato he could acknowledge their unrivalled excellence; in translating
Panaetius or Philodemus he would feel his own immeasurable
superiority.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The greater number of long syllables, combined with the
paucity of diphthongs and the consequent monotony of vocalization,
and the uniformity of the accent, lent a weight and dignity of
movement to the language which well suited the national <i>gravitas</i>.
The precision of grammatical rules and the entire absence of
dialectic forms from the written literature contributed to maintain
the character of unity which marked the Roman republic as compared
with the multiplicity of Greek states. It was remarked by
Francis Bacon that artistic and imaginative nations indulge freely
in verbal compounds, practical nations in simple concrete terms.
In this respect, too, Latin contrasts with Greek. The attempts
made by some of the earlier poets to indulge in novel compounds
was felt to be out of harmony with the genius of the language.
Composition, though necessarily employed, was kept within
narrow limits, and the words thus produced have a sharply
defined meaning, wholly unlike the poetical vagueness of some
of the Greek compounds. The vocabulary of the language, though
receiving accessions from time to time in accordance with practical
needs, was rarely enriched by the products of a spontaneous
creativeness. In literature the taste of the educated town
circles gave the law; and these, trained in the study of the Greek
masters of style, required something which should reproduce
for them the harmony of the Greek period. Happily the orators
who gave form to Latin prose were able to meet the demand
without departing from the spirit of their own language.<a name="fa7a" id="fa7a" href="#ft7a"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

<p>53. <i>Cicero and Caesar.</i>&mdash;To Cicero especially the Romans
owed the realization of what was possible to their language
in the way of artistic finish of style. He represents a protest
at one and the same time against the inroads of the <i>plebeius
sermo</i>, vulgarized by the constant influx of non-Italian provincials
into Rome, and the &ldquo;jargon of spurious and partial culture&rdquo;
in vogue among the Roman pupils of the Asiatic rhetoricians.
His essential service was to have caught the tone and style of
the true Roman <i>urbanitas</i>, and to have fixed it in extensive and
widely read speeches and treatises as the final model of classical
prose. The influence of Caesar was wholly in the same direction.
His cardinal principle was that every new-fangled and affected
expression, from whatever quarter it might come, should be
avoided by the writer, as rocks by the mariner. His own style
for straightforward simplicity and purity has never been surpassed;
and it is not without full reason that Cicero and Caesar
are regarded as the models of classical prose. But, while they
fixed the type of the best Latin, they did not and could not alter
its essential character. In subtlety, in suggestiveness, in many-sided
grace and versatility, it remained far inferior to the Greek.
But for dignity and force, for cadence and rhythm, for clearness
and precision, the best Latin prose remains unrivalled.</p>

<p>It is needless to dwell upon the grammar or vocabulary of
Cicero. His language is universally taken as the normal type of
Latin; and, as hitherto the history of the language has been
traced by marking differences from his usage, so the same method
may be followed for what remains.</p>

<p>54. <i>Varro</i>, &ldquo;the most learned of the ancients,&rdquo; a friend and
contemporary of Cicero, seems to have rejected the periodic
rhythmical style of Cicero, and to have fallen back upon a more
archaic structure. Mommsen says of one passage &ldquo;the clauses
of the sentence are arranged on the thread of the relative like
dead thrushes on a string.&rdquo; But, in spite (some would say,
because) of his old-fashioned tendencies, his language shows
great vigour and spirit. In his Menippean satires he intentionally
made free use of plebeian expressions, while rising at times to
a real grace and showing often fresh humour. His treatise <i>De Re
Rustica</i>, in the form of a dialogue, is the most agreeable of his
works, and where the nature of his subject allows it there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>
much vivacity and dramatic picturesqueness, although the
precepts are necessarily given in a terse and abrupt form. His
sentences are as a rule co-ordinated, with but few connecting
links; his diction contains many antiquated or unique words.</p>

<p>55. <i>Sallust.</i>&mdash;In Sallust, a younger contemporary of Cicero,
we have the earliest complete specimen of historical narrative.
It is probably due to his subject-matter, at least in part, that his
style is marked by frequent archaisms; but something must
be ascribed to intentional imitation of the earlier chroniclers,
which led him to be called <i>priscorum Catonisque verborum
ineruditissimus fur</i>. His archaisms consist partly of words and
phrases used in a sense for which we have only early authorities,
<i>e.g.</i> <i>cum animo habere</i>, &amp;c., <i>animos tollere</i>, <i>bene factum</i>, <i>consultor</i>,
<i>prosapia</i>, <i>dolus</i>, <i>venenum</i>, <i>obsequela</i>, <i>inquies</i>, <i>sallere</i>, <i>occipere</i>,
<i>collibeo</i>, and the like, where we may notice especially the fondness
for frequentatives, which he shares with the early comedy;
partly in inflections which were growing obsolete, such as <i>senati</i>,
<i>solui</i>, <i>comperior</i> (dep.), <i>neglegisset</i>, <i>vis</i> (acc. pl.) <i>nequitur</i>. In
syntax his constructions are for the most part those of the
contemporary writers.</p>

<p>56. <i>Lucretius</i> is largely archaic in his style. We find <i>im</i> for
<i>eum</i>, <i>endo</i> for <i>in</i>, <i>illae</i>, <i>ullae</i>, <i>unae</i> and <i>aliae</i> as genitives, <i>alid</i>
for <i>aliud</i>, <i>rabies</i> as a genitive by the side of genitives in -<i>ai</i>,
ablatives in -<i>i</i> like <i>colli</i>, <i>orbi</i>, <i>parti</i>, nominatives in <i>s</i> for <i>r</i>, like
<i>colos</i>, <i>vapos</i>, <i>humos</i>. In verbs there are <i>scatit</i>, <i>fulgit</i>, <i>quaesit</i>,
<i>confluxet</i> = <i>confluxisset</i>, <i>recesse</i> = <i>recessisse</i>, <i>induiacere</i> for <i>inicere</i>;
simple forms like <i>fligere</i>, <i>lacere</i>, <i>cedere</i>, <i>stinguere</i> for the more
usual compounds, the infinitive passive in -<i>ier</i>, and archaic
forms from <i>esse</i> like <i>siet</i>, <i>escit</i>, <i>fuat</i>. Sometimes he indulges
in tmesis which reminds us of Ennius: <i>inque pediri</i>, <i>disque
supata</i>, <i>ordia prima</i>. But this archaic tinge is adopted only for
poetical purposes, and as a proof of his devotion to the earlier
masters of his art; it does not affect the general substance of
his style, which is of the freshest and most vigorous stamp.
But the purity of his idiom is not gained by any slavish adherence
to a recognized vocabulary: he coins words freely; Munro
has noted more than a hundred <span class="grk" title="hapax legomena">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</span>, or words which
he alone among good writers uses. Many of these are formed
on familiar models, such as compounds and frequentatives;
others are directly borrowed from the Greek apparently with a
view to sweetness of rhythm (ii. 412, v. 334, 505); others again
(forty or more in number) are compounds of a kind which
the classical language refused to adopt, such as <i>silvifragus</i>,
<i>terriloquus</i>, <i>perterricrepus</i>. He represents not so much a stage
in the history of the language as a protest against the tendencies
fashionable in his own time. But his influence was deep upon
Virgil, and through him upon all subsequent Latin literature.</p>

<p>57. <i>Catullus</i> gives us the type of the language of the cultivated
circles, lifted into poetry by the simple directness with which
it is used to express emotion. In his heroic and elegiac poems
he did not escape the influence of the Alexandrian school, and
his genius is ill suited for long-continued flights; but in his
lyrical poems his language is altogether perfect. As Macaulay
says: &ldquo;No Latin writer is so Greek. The simplicity, the pathos,
the perfect grace, which I find in the great Athenian models are
all in Catullus, and in him alone of the Romans.&rdquo; The language
of these poems comes nearest perhaps to that of Cicero&rsquo;s more
intimate letters. It is full of colloquial idioms and familiar
language, of the diminutives of affection or of playfulness.
Greek words are rare, especially in the lyrics, and those which
are employed are only such as had come to be current coin.
Archaisms are but sparingly introduced; but for metrical
reasons he has four instances of the inf. pass., in -<i>ier</i>, and several
contracted forms; we find also <i>alis</i> and <i>alid</i>, <i>uni</i> (gen.), and the
antiquated <i>tetuli</i> and <i>recepso</i>. There are traces of the popular
language in the shortened imperatives <i>cav&#277;</i> and <i>man&#277;</i>, in the
analytic perfect <i>paratam habes</i>, and in the use of <i>unus</i> approaching
that of the indefinite article.</p>

<p>58. <i>Horace.</i>&mdash;The poets of the Augustan age mark the opening
of a new chapter in the history of the Latin language. The
influence of Horace was less than that of his friend and contemporary
Virgil; for Horace worked in a field of his own, and,
although Statius imitated his lyrics, and Persius and Juvenal,
especially the former, his satires, on the whole there are few
traces of any deep marks left by him on the language of later
writers. In his <i>Satires</i> and <i>Epistles</i> the diction is that of the
contemporary <i>urbanitas</i>, differing hardly at all from that of
Cicero in his epistles and dialogues. The occasional archaisms,
such as the syncope in <i>erepsemus</i>, <i>evasse</i>, <i>surrexe</i>, the infinitives
in -ier, and the genitives <i>deum</i>, <i>divum</i>, may be explained as still
conversationally allowable, though ceasing to be current in
literature; and a similar explanation may account for plebeian
terms, <i>e.g.</i> <i>balatro</i>, <i>blatero</i>, <i>giarrio</i>, <i>mutto</i>, <i>vappa</i>, <i>caldus</i>, <i>soldus</i>,
<i>surpite</i>, for the numerous diminutives, and for such pronouns,
adverbs, conjunctions and turns of expression as were common
in prose, but not found, or found but rarely, in elevated poetry.
Greek words are used sparingly, not with the licence which he
censures in Lucilius, and in his hexameters are framed according
to Latin rules. In the <i>Odes</i>, on the other hand, the language is
much more precisely limited. There are practically no archaisms
(<i>spargier</i> in Carm. iv. 11. 8 is a doubtful exception), or plebeian
expressions; Greek inflections are employed, but not with the
licence of Catullus; there are no datives in <i>&#301;</i> or <i>s&#301;n</i> like <i>Tethy&#301;</i>
or <i>Dryasin</i>; Greek constructions are fairly numerous, <i>e.g.</i> the
genitive with verbs like <i>regnare</i>, <i>abstinere</i>, <i>desinere</i>, and with
adjectives, as <i>integer vitae</i>, the so-called Greek accusative, the
dative with verbs of contest, like <i>luctari</i>, <i>decertare</i>, the transitive
use of many intransitive verbs in the past participle, as <i>regnatus</i>,
<i>triumphatus</i>; and finally there is a &ldquo;prolative&rdquo; use of the
infinitive after verbs and adjectives, where prose would have
employed other constructions, which, though not limited to
Horace, is more common with him than with other poets.
Compounds are very sparingly employed, and apparently only
when sanctioned by authority. His own innovations in vocabulary
are not numerous. About eighty <span class="grk" title="hapax legomena">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</span> have
been noted. Like Virgil, he shows his exquisite skill in the use
of language rather in the selection from already existing stores,
than in the creation of new resources: <i>tantum series iuncturaque
pollet</i>. But both his diction and his syntax left much less marked
traces upon succeeding writers than did those of either Virgil
or Ovid.</p>

<p>59. <i>Virgil.</i>&mdash;In Virgil the Latin language reached its full
maturity. What Cicero was to the period, Virgil was to the
hexameter; indeed the changes that he wrought were still
more marked, inasmuch as the language of verse admits of
greater subtlety and finish than even the most artistic prose.
For the straightforward idiomatic simplicity of Lucretius and
Catullus he substituted a most exact and felicitous diction, rich
with the suggestion of the most varied sources of inspiration.
Sometimes it is a phrase of Homer&rsquo;s &ldquo;conveyed&rdquo; literally with
happy boldness, sometimes it is a line of Ennius, or again some
artistic Sophoclean combination. Virgil was equally familiar
with the great Greek models of style and with the earlier Latin
poets. This learning, guided by an unerring sense of fitness and
harmony, enabled him to give to his diction a music which recalls
at once the fullest tones of the Greek lyre and the lofty strains
of the most genuinely national song. His love of antiquarianism
in language has often been noticed, but it never passes into
pedantry. His vocabulary and constructions are often such as
would have conveyed to his contemporaries a grateful flavour of
the past, but they would never have been unintelligible. Forms
like <i>iusso</i>, <i>olle</i> or <i>admittier</i> can have delayed no one.</p>

<p>In the details of syntax it is difficult to notice any peculiarly
Virgilian points, for the reason that his language, like that of
Cicero, became the canon, departures from which were accounted
irregularities. But we may notice as favourite constructions a
free use of oblique cases in the place of the more definite construction
with prepositions usual in prose, <i>e.g.</i> <i>it clamor caelo</i>,
<i>flet noctem</i>, <i>rivis currentia vina</i>, <i>bacchatam iugis Naxon</i>, and many
similar phrases; the employment of some substantives as
adjectives, like <i>venator canis</i>, and vice versa, as <i>plurimus volitans</i>;
a proleptic use of adjectives, as <i>tristia torquebit</i>; idioms involving
<i>ille</i>, <i>atque</i>, <i>deinde</i>, <i>haud</i>, <i>quin</i>, <i>vix</i>, and the frequent occurrence of
passive verbs in their earlier reflexive sense, as <i>induor</i>, <i>velor</i>, <i>pascor</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span></p>

<p>60. <i>Livy.</i>&mdash;In the singularly varied and beautiful style of
Livy we find Latin prose in rich maturity. To a training in the
rhetorical schools, and perhaps professional experience as a
teacher of rhetoric, he added a thorough familiarity with contemporary
poetry and with the Greek language; and these
attainments have all deeply coloured his language. It is probable
that the variety of style naturally suggested by the wide range
of his subject matter was increased by a half-unconscious
adoption of the phrases and constructions of the different
authorities whom he followed in different parts of his work;
and the industry of German critics has gone far to demonstrate
a conclusion likely enough in itself. Hence perhaps comes the
fairly long list of archaisms, especially in formulae (cf. K√ºhnast,
<i>Liv. Synt.</i> pp. 14-18). These are, however, purely isolated
phenomena, which do not affect the general tone. It is different
with the poetical constructions and Graecisms, which appear on
every page. Of the latter we find numerous instances in the use
of the cases, <i>e.g.</i> in genitives like <i>via praedae omissae</i>, <i>oppidum
Antiochiae</i>, <i>aequum campi</i>; in datives like <i>quibusdam volentibus
erat</i>; in accusatives like <i>iurare calumniam</i>, <i>certare multam</i>; an
especially frequent use of transitive verbs absolutely; and the
constant omission of the reflexive pronoun as the subject of an
infinitive in reported speech. To the same source must be
assigned the very frequent pregnant construction with prepositions,
an attraction of relatives, and the great extension of the
employment of relative adverbs of place instead of relative
pronouns, <i>e.g.</i> <i>quo</i> = <i>in quem</i>. Among his poetical characteristics
we may place the extensive list of words which are found for the
first time in his works and in those of Virgil or Ovid, and perhaps
his common use of concrete words for collective, <i>e.g.</i> <i>eques</i> for
<i>equitatus</i>, of abstract terms such as <i>remigium</i>, <i>servitia</i>, <i>robora</i>,
and of frequentative verbs, to say nothing of poetical phrases like
<i>haec ubi dicta dedit, adversum montium</i>, &amp;c. Indications of the
extended use of the subjunctive, which he shares with contemporary
writers, especially poets, are found in the construction
of <i>ante quam</i>, <i>post quam</i> with this mood, even when there is no
underlying notion of anticipation, of <i>donec</i>, and of <i>cum</i> meaning
&ldquo;whenever.&rdquo; On the other hand, <i>forsitan</i> and <i>quamvis</i>, as in the
poets, are used with the indicative in forgetfulness of their
original force. Among his individual peculiarities may be
noticed the large number of verbal nouns in -<i>tus</i> (for which
Cicero prefers forms in -<i>tio</i>) and in -<i>tor</i>, and the extensive use
of the past passive participle to replace an abstract substantive,
<i>e.g.</i> <i>ex dictatorio imperio concusso</i>. In the arrangement of words
Livy is much more free than any previous prose writer, aiming,
like the poets, at the most effective order. His periods are constructed
with less regularity than those of Cicero, but they gain
at least as much in variety and energy as they lose in uniformity
of rhythm and artistic finish. His style cannot be more fitly
described than in the language of Quintilian, who speaks of his
<i>mira iucunditas</i> and <i>lactea ubertas</i>.</p>

<p>61. <i>Propertius.</i>&mdash;The language of Propertius is too distinctly
his own to call for detailed examination here. It cannot be
taken as a specimen of the great current of the Latin language;
it is rather a tributary springing from a source apart, tinging
to some slight extent the stream into which it pours itself, but
soon ceasing to affect it in any perceptible fashion. &ldquo;His
obscurity, his indirectness and his incoherence&rdquo; (to adopt the
words of J. P. Postgate) were too much out of harmony with
the Latin taste for him to be regarded as in any sense representative;
sometimes he seems to be hardly writing Latin at all.
Partly from his own strikingly independent genius, partly from
his profound and not always judicious study of the Alexandrian
writers, his poems abound in phrases and constructions which
are without a parallel in Latin poetry. His archaisms and
Graecisms, both in diction and in syntax, are very numerous;
but frequently there is a freedom in the use of cases and prepositions
which can only be due to bold and independent innovations.
His style well deserves a careful study for its own sake
(cf. J. P. Postgate&rsquo;s <i>Introduction</i>, pp. lvii.-cxxv.); but it is of
comparatively little significance in the history of the language.</p>

<p>62. <i>Ovid.</i>&mdash;The brief and few poems of Tibullus supply only
what is given much more fully in the works of Ovid. In these
we have the language recognized as that best fitted for poetry
by the fashionable circles in the later years of Augustus. The
style of Ovid bears many traces of the imitation of Virgil, Horace
and Propertius, but it is not less deeply affected by the rhetoric
of the schools. His never-failing fertility of fancy and command
of diction often lead him into a diffuseness which mars the effect
of his best works; according to Quintilian it was only in his
(lost) tragedy of <i>Medea</i> that he showed what real excellence he
might have reached if he had chosen to control his natural
powers. His influence on later poets was largely for evil; if he
taught them smoothness of versification and polish of language,
he also co-operated powerfully with the practice of recitation to
lead them to aim at rhetorical point and striking turns of expression,
instead of a firm grasp of a subject as a whole, and due
subordination of the several parts to the general impression.
Ovid&rsquo;s own influence on language was not great; he took the
diction of poetry as he found it, formed by the labours of his
predecessors; the conflict between the archaistic and the
Graecizing schools was already settled in favour of the latter;
and all that he did was to accept the generally accepted models
as supplying the material in moulding which his luxuriant fancy
could have free play. He has no deviations from classical
syntax but those which were coming into fashion in his time
(<i>e.g.</i> <i>forsitan</i> and <i>quamvis</i> with the indic., the dative of the agent
with passive verbs, the ablative for the accusative of time, the
infinitive after adjectives like <i>certus</i>, <i>aptus</i>, &amp;c.), and but few
peculiarities in his vocabulary. It is only in the letters from the
Pontus that laxities of construction are detected, which show
that the purity of his Latin was impaired by his residence away
from Rome, and perhaps by increasing carelessness of composition.</p>

<p>63. <i>The Latin of Daily Life.</i>&mdash;While the leading writers of the
Ciceronian and Augustan eras enable us to trace the gradual
development of the Latin language to its utmost finish as an
instrument of literary expression, there are some less important
authors who supply valuable evidence of the character of the
<i>sermo plebeius</i>. Among them may be placed the authors of the
<i>Bellum Africanum</i> and the <i>Bellum Hispaniense</i> appended to
Caesar&rsquo;s Commentaries. These are not only far inferior to the
exquisite <i>urbanitas</i> of Caesar&rsquo;s own writings; they are much
rougher in style even than the less polished <i>Bellum Alexandrinum</i>
and <i>De Bello Gallico Liber VIII.</i>, which are now with justice
ascribed to Hirtius. There is sufficient difference between the
two to justify us in assuming two different authors; but both
freely employ words and constructions which are at once antiquated
and vulgar. The writer of the <i>Bellum Alexandrinum</i>
uses a larger number of diminutives within his short treatise
than Caesar in nearly ten times the space; <i>postquam</i> and <i>ubi</i>
are used with the pluperfect subjunctive; there are numerous
forms unknown to the best Latin, like <i>tristimonia</i>, <i>exporrigere</i>,
<i>cruciabiliter</i> and <i>convulnero</i>; <i>potior</i> is followed by the accusative,
a simple relative by the subjunctive. There is also a very
common use of the pluperfect for the imperfect, which seems a
mark of this <i>plebeius sermo</i> (Nipperdey, <i>Quaest. Caes.</i> pp. 13-30).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Another example of what we may call the Latin of business life is
supplied by Vitruvius. Besides the obscurity of many of his technical
expressions, there is a roughness and looseness in his language, far
removed from a literary style; he shares the incorrect use of the
pluperfect, and uses plebeian forms like <i>calefaciuntur</i>, <i>faciliter</i>,
<i>expertiones</i> and such careless phrases as <i>rogavit Archimedem uti in
se sumeret sibi de eo cogitationem</i>. At a somewhat later stage we
have, not merely plebeian, but also provincial Latin represented in
the Satyricon of Petronius. The narrative and the poems which are
introduced into it are written in a style distinguished only by the
ordinary peculiarities of silver Latinity; but in the numerous
conversations the distinctions of language appropriate to the various
speakers are accurately preserved; and we have in the talk of the
slaves and provincials a perfect storehouse of words and constructions
of the greatest linguistic value. Among the unclassical forms
and constructions may be noticed masculines like <i>fatus</i>, <i>vinus</i>,
<i>balneus</i>, <i>fericulus</i> and <i>lactem</i> (for <i>lac</i>), <i>striga</i> for <i>strix</i>, <i>gaudimonium</i>
and <i>tristimonium</i>, <i>sanguen</i>, <i>manducare</i>, <i>nutricare</i>, <i>molestare</i>, <i>nesapius</i>
(<i>sapius</i> = Fr. <i>sage</i>), <i>rostrum</i> (= <i>os</i>), <i>ipsimus</i> (= master), <i>scordalias</i>,
<i>baro</i>, and numerous diminutives like <i>camella</i>, <i>audaculus</i>, <i>potiuncula</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
<i>savunculum</i>, <i>offla</i>, <i>peduclus</i>, <i>corcillum</i>, with constructions such as
<i>maledicere</i> and <i>persuadere</i> with the accusative, and <i>adiutare</i> with the
dative, and the deponent forms <i>pudeatur</i> and <i>ridetur</i>. Of especial
interest for the Romance languages are <i>astrum</i> (<i>d√©sastre</i>), <i>berbex</i>
(<i>br√©bis</i>), <i>botellus</i> (<i>boyau</i>), <i>improperare</i>, <i>muttus</i>, <i>naufragare</i>.</p>

<p>Suetonius (<i>Aug.</i> <i>c.</i> 87) gives an interesting selection of plebeian
words employed in conversation by Augustus, who for the rest was
something of a purist in his written utterances: <i>ponit assidue et pro
stulto baceolum, et pro pullo pulleiaceum, et pro cerrito vacerrosum, et
vapide se habere pro male, et betizare pro languere, quod vulgo lachanizare
dicitur</i>.</p>

<p>The inscriptions, especially those of Pompeii, supply abundant
evidence of the corruptions both of forms and of pronunciation
common among the vulgar. It is not easy always to determine
whether a mutilated form is evidence of a letter omitted in pronunciation,
or only in writing; but it is clear that the ordinary man
habitually dropped final <i>m</i>, <i>s</i>, and <i>t</i>, omitted <i>n</i> before <i>s</i>, and pronounced
<i>&#301;</i> like <i>&#277;</i>. There are already signs of the decay of <i>ae</i> to <i>e</i>,
which later on became almost universal. The additions to our
vocabulary are slight and unimportant (cf. <i>Corpus Inscr.</i> Lat. iv.,
with Zangemeister&rsquo;s <i>Indices</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>64. To turn to the language of literature. In the dark days
of Tiberius and the two succeeding emperors a paralysis seemed
to have come upon prose and poetry alike. With the one exception
of oratory, literature had long been the utterance of a
narrow circle, not the expression of the energies of national life;
and now, while all free speech in the popular assemblies was
silenced, the nobles were living under a suspicious despotism,
which, whatever the advantage which it brought to the poorer
classes and to the provincials, was to them a reign of terror.
It is no wonder that the fifty years after the accession of Tiberius
are a blank as regards all higher literature. Velleius Paterculus,
Valerius Maximus, Celsus and Phaedrus give specimens of the
Latin of the time, but the style of no one of these, classical for
the most part in vocabulary, but occasionally approaching the
later usages in syntax, calls for special analysis. The elder
Seneca in his collection of <i>suasoriae</i> and <i>controversiae</i> supplies
examples of the barren quibblings by which the young Romans
were trained in the rhetorical schools. A course of instruction,
which may have been of service when its end was efficiency in
active public life, though even then not without its serious drawbacks,
as is shown by Cicero in his treatise <i>De Oratore</i>, became
seriously injurious when its object was merely idle display.
Prose came to be overloaded with ornament, and borrowed too
often the language, though not the genius, of poetry; while
poetry in its turn, partly owing to the fashion of recitation,
became a string of rhetorical points.</p>

<p>65. <i>Seneca, Persius and Lucan.</i>&mdash;In the writers of Nero&rsquo;s age
there are already plain indications of the evil effects of the
rhetorical schools upon language as well as literature. The
leading man of letters was undoubtedly Seneca the younger,
&ldquo;the Ovid of prose&rdquo;; and his style set the model which it
became the fashion to imitate. But it could not commend itself
to the judgment of sound critics like Quintilian, who held firmly
to the great masters of an earlier time. He admits its brilliance,
and the fertility of its pointed reflections, but charges the author
justly with want of self-restraint, jerkiness, frequent repetitions
and tawdry tricks of rhetoric. Seneca was the worst of models,
and pleased by his very faults. In his tragedies the rhetorical
elaboration of the style only serves to bring into prominence
the frigidity and frequent bad taste of the matter. But his
diction is on the whole fairly classical; he is, in the words of
Muretus, <i>vetusti sermonis diligentior quam quidam inepte fastidiosi
suspicantur</i>. In Persius there is a constant straining after
rhetorical effect, which fills his verses with harsh and obscure
expressions. The careful choice of diction by which his master
Horace makes every word tell is exaggerated into an endeavour
to gain force and freshness by the most contorted phrases. The
sin of allusiveness is fostered by the fashion of the day for
epigram, till his lines are barely intelligible after repeated reading.
Conington happily suggested that this style was assumed
only for satiric purposes, and pointed out that when not writing
satire Persius was as simple and unaffected as Horace himself.
This view, while it relieves Persius of much of the censure
which has been directed against his want of judgment, makes
him all the more typical a representative of this stage of silver
Latinity. In his contemporary Lucan we have another example
of the faults of a style especially attractive to the young, handled
by a youth of brilliant but ill-disciplined powers. The <i>Pharsalia</i>
abounds in spirited rhetoric, in striking epigram, in high sounding
declamation; but there are no flights of sustained imagination,
no ripe wisdom, no self-control in avoiding the exaggerated or
the repulsive, no mature philosophy of life or human destiny.
Of all the Latin poets he is the least Virgilian. It has been said
of him that he corrupted the style of poetry, not less than Seneca
that of prose.</p>

<p>66. <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Quintilian</i>, <i>Frontinus</i>.&mdash;In the elder Pliny the same
tendencies are seen occasionally breaking out in the midst of the
prosaic and inartistic form in which he gives out the stores of his
cumbrous erudition. Wherever he attempts a loftier tone than
that of the mere compiler, he falls into the tricks of Seneca.
The nature of his encyclopaedic subject matter naturally makes
his vocabulary very extensive; but in syntax and general tone
of language he does not differ materially from contemporary
writers. Quintilian is of interest especially for the sound judgment
which led him to a true appreciation of the writers of
Rome&rsquo;s golden age. He set himself strenuously to resist the
tawdry rhetoric fashionable in his own time, and to hold up
before his pupils purer and loftier models. His own criticisms
are marked by excellent taste, and often by great happiness of
expression, which is pointed without being unduly epigrammatic.
But his own style did not escape, as indeed it hardly could, the
influences of his time; and in many small points his language
falls short of classical purity. There is more approach to the
simplicity of the best models in Frontinus, who furnishes a
striking proof that it was rather the corruption of literary taste
than any serious change in the language of ordinary cultivated
men to which the prevalent style was due. Writing on practical
matters&mdash;the art of war and the water-supply of Rome&mdash;he goes
straight to the point without rhetorical flourishes; and the
ornaments of style which he occasionally introduces serve to
embellish but not to distort his thought.</p>

<p>67. <i>The Flavian Age.</i>&mdash;The epic poets of the Flavian age
present a striking contrast to the writers of the Claudian period.
As a strained originality was the cardinal fault of the one school,
so a tame and slavish following of authority is the mark of
the other. The general <i>correctness</i> of this period may perhaps
be ascribed (with Merivale) partly to the political conditions,
partly to the establishment of professional schools. Teachers
like Quintilian must have done much to repress extravagance
of thought and language; but they could not kindle the spark
of genius. Valerius Flaccus, Silius Italicus and Papinius Statius
are all correct in diction and in rhythm, and abound in learning;
but their inspiration is drawn from books and not from nature or
the heart; details are elaborated to the injury of the impression
of the whole; every line is laboured, and overcharged with
epigrammatic rhetoric. Statius shows by far the greatest
natural ability and freshness; but he attempts to fill a broad
canvas with drawing and colouring suited only to a miniature.
Juvenal exemplifies the tendencies of the language of his time,
as moulded by a singularly powerful mind. A careful study of
the earlier poets, especially Virgil and Lucan, has kept his
language up to a high standard of purity. His style is eminently
rhetorical; but it is rhetoric of real power. The concise brevity
by which it is marked seems to have been the result of a deliberate
attempt to mould his natural diffuseness into the form recognized
as most appropriate for satire. In his verses we notice a few
metrical peculiarities which represent the pronunciation of his
age, especially the shortening of the final -<i>o</i> in verbs, but as a
rule they conform to the Virgilian standard. In Martial the
tendency of this period to witty epigram finds its most perfect
embodiment, combined with finished versification.</p>

<p>68. <i>Pliny the Younger and Tacitus.</i>&mdash;The typical prose-writers
of this time are Pliny the younger and Tacitus. Some features
of the style of Tacitus are peculiar to himself; but on the whole
the following statement represents the tendencies shared in
greater or less degree by all the writers of this period. The
gains lie mainly in the direction of a more varied and occasionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span>
more effective syntax; its most striking defect is a lack of
harmony in the periods, of arrangements in words, of variety
in particles arising from the loose connexion of sentences. The
vocabulary is extended, but there are losses as well as gains.
Quintilian&rsquo;s remarks are fully borne out by the evidence of
extant authorities: on the one hand, <i>quid quod nihil iam proprium
placet, dum parum creditur disertum, quod et alius dixisset</i> (viii.
<i>prooem.</i> 24); <i>a corruptissimo quoque poetarum figuras seu translationes
mutuamur; tum demum ingeniosi scilicet, si ad intelligendos
nos opus sit ingenio</i> (<i>ib.</i> 25); <i>sordet omne quod natura dictavit</i>
(<i>ib.</i> 26); on the other hand, <i>nunc utique, cum haec exercitatio
procul a veritate seiuncta laboret incredibili verborum fastidio, ac
sibi magnam partem sermonis absciderit</i> (viii. 3, 23), <i>multa cotidie
ab antiquis ficta moriuntur</i> (<i>ib.</i> 6, 32). A writer like Suetonius
therefore did good service in introducing into his writings terms
and phrases borrowed, not from the rhetoricians, but from the
usage of daily life.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>69. In the vocabulary of Tacitus there are to be noted:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Words borrowed (consciously or unconsciously) from the
classical poets, especially Virgil, occurring for the most part also in
contemporary prose. Of these Dr√§ger gives a list of ninety-five
(<i>Syntax und Stil des Tacitus</i>, p. 96).</p>

<p>2. Words occurring only, or for the first time, in Tacitus. These
are for the most part new formations or compounds from stems
already in use, especially verbal substantives in -<i>tor</i> and -<i>sor</i>, -<i>tus</i> and
-<i>sus</i>, -<i>tura</i> and -<i>mentum</i>, with new frequentatives.</p>

<p>3. Words used with a meaning (<i>a</i>) not found in earlier prose,
but sometimes borrowed from the poets, <i>e.g.</i> <i>componere</i>, &ldquo;to bury&rdquo;;
<i>scriptura</i>, &ldquo;a writing&rdquo;; <i>ferratus</i> &ldquo;armed with a sword&rdquo;; (<i>b</i>)
peculiar to later writers, <i>e.g.</i> <i>numerosus</i>, &ldquo;numerous&rdquo;; <i>famosus</i>,
&ldquo;famous&rdquo;; <i>decollare</i>, &ldquo;to behead&rdquo;; <i>imputare</i>, &ldquo;to take credit
for,&rdquo; &amp;c.; (<i>c</i>) restricted to Tacitus himself, <i>e.g.</i> <i>dispergere</i> = <i>divolgare</i>.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, Tacitus likes to use a simple verb instead of
a compound one, after the fashion of the poets, employs a pluperfect
for a perfect, and (like Livy and sometimes Caesar) aims at vividness
and variety by retaining the present and perfect subjunctive in
indirect speech even after historical tenses. Collective words are
followed by a plural far more commonly than in Cicero. The ellipse
of a verb is more frequent. The use of the cases approximates to
that of the poets, and is even more free. The accusative of limitation
is common in Tacitus, though never found in Quintilian. Compound
verbs are frequently followed by the accusative where the dative
might have been expected; and the Virgilian construction of an
accusative with middle and passive verbs is not unusual. The
dative of purpose and the dative with a substantive in place of a
genitive are more common with Tacitus than with any writer.
The ablative of separation is used without a preposition, even with
names of countries and with common nouns; the ablative of place
is employed similarly without a preposition; the ablative of time
has sometimes the force of duration; the instrumental ablative is
employed even of persons. A large extension is given to the use
of the quantitative genitive after neuter adjectives and pronouns,
and even adverbs, and to the genitive with active participles; and
the genitive of relation after adjectives is (probably by a Graecism)
very freely employed. In regard to prepositions, there are special
uses of <i>citra</i>, <i>erga</i>, <i>iuxta</i> and <i>tenus</i> to be noted, and a frequent tendency
to interchange the use of a preposition with that of a simple case in
corresponding clauses. In subordinate sentences <i>quod</i> is used for
&ldquo;the fact that,&rdquo; and sometimes approaches the later use of &ldquo;that&rdquo;;
the infinitive follows many verbs and adjectives that do not admit
of this construction in classical prose; the accusative and infinitive
are used after negative expressions of doubt, and even in modal
and hypothetical clauses.</p>

<p>Like Livy, the writers of this time freely employ the subjunctive
of repeated action with a relative, and extend its use to relative
conjunctions, which he does not. In clauses of comparison and
proportion there is frequently an ellipse of a verb (with <i>nihil aliud
quam</i>, <i>ut</i>, <i>tanquam</i>); <i>tanquam</i>, <i>quasi</i> and <i>velut</i> are used to imply not
comparison but alleged reason; <i>quin</i> and <i>quominus</i> are interchanged
at pleasure. <i>Quamquam</i> and <i>quamvis</i> are commonly
followed by the subjunctive, even when denoting facts. The free
use of the genitive and dative of the gerundive to denote purpose is
common in Tacitus, the former being almost limited to him. Livy&rsquo;s
practice in the use of participles is extended even beyond the limits
to which he restricts it. It has been calculated that where Caesar
uses five participial clauses, Livy has sixteen, Tacitus twenty-four.</p>

<p>In his compressed brevity Tacitus may be said to be individual;
but in the poetical colouring of his diction, in the rhetorical cast of
his sentences, and in his love for picturesqueness and variety he is a
true representative of his time.</p>
</div>

<p>70. <i>Suetonius.</i>&mdash;The language of Suetonius is of interest as
giving a specimen of silver Latinity almost entirely free from
personal idiosyncrasies; his expressions are regular and straightforward,
clear and business-like; and, while in grammar he
does not attain to classical purity, he is comparatively free from
rhetorical affectations.</p>

<p>71. <i>The African Latinity.</i>&mdash;A new era commences with the
accession of Hadrian (117). As the preceding half century had
been marked by the influence of Spanish Latinity (the Senecas,
Lucan, Martial, Quintilian), so in this the African style was
paramount. This is the period of affected archaisms and
pedantic learning, combined at times with a reckless love of
innovation and experiment, resulting in the creation of a large
number of new formations and in the adoption of much of the
plebeian dialect. Fronto and Apuleius mark a strong reaction
against the culture of the preceding century, and for evil far
more than for good the chain of literary tradition was broken.
The language which had been unduly refined and elaborated
now relapsed into a tasteless and confused patch-work, without
either harmony or brilliance of colouring. In the case of the
former the subject matter is no set-off against the inferiority of
the style. He deliberately attempts to go back to the obsolete
diction of writers like Cato and Ennius. We find compounds
like <i>altipendulus</i>, <i>nudiustertianus</i>, <i>tolutiloquentia</i>, diminutives
such as <i>matercella</i>, <i>anulla</i>, <i>passercula</i>, <i>studiolum</i>, forms like
<i>congarrire</i>, <i>disconcinnus</i>, <i>pedetemptius</i>, <i>desiderantissimus</i> (passive),
<i>conticinium</i>; <i>gaudeo</i>, <i>oboedio</i> and <i>perfungor</i> are used with an
accusative, <i>modestus</i> with a genitive. On the other hand he
actually attempts to revive the form <i>asa</i> for <i>ara</i>. In Apuleius
the archaic element is only one element in the queer mixture
which constitutes his style, and it probably was not intended
to give the tone to the whole. Poetical and prosaic phrases,
Graecisms, solecisms, jingling assonances, quotations and
coinages apparently on the spur of the moment, all appear in
this wonderful medley. There are found such extraordinary
genitives as <i>sitire beatitudinis</i>, <i>cenae pignerarer</i>, <i>incoram omnium</i>,
<i>foras corporis</i>, sometimes heaped one upon another as <i>fluxos
vestium Arsacidas et frugum pauperes Ityraeos et odorum divites
Arabas</i>. Diminutives are coined with reckless freedom, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>diutule</i>, <i>longule</i>, <i>mundule amicta el altiuscule sub ipsas papillas
succinctula</i>. He confesses himself that he is writing in a language
not familiar to him: <i>In urbe Latia advena studiorum Quiritium
indigenam sermonem aerumnabili labore, nullo magistro praeeunte,
aggressus excolui</i>; and the general impression of his style fully
bears out his confession. Melanchthon is hardly too severe when
he says that Apuleius brays like his own ass. The language of
Aulus Gellius is much superior in purity; but still it abounds
in rare and archaic words, <i>e.g.</i> <i>edulcare</i>, <i>recentari</i>, <i>aeruscator</i>,
and in meaningless frequentatives like <i>solitavisse</i>. He has some
admirable remarks on the pedantry of those who delighted in
obsolete expressions (xi. 7) such as <i>apluda</i>, <i>flocus</i> and <i>bovinator</i>;
but his practice falls far short of his theory.</p>

<p>72. <i>The Lawyers.</i>&mdash;The style of the eminent lawyers of this
period, foremost among whom is Gaius, deserves especial notice
as showing well one of the characteristic excellences of the Latin
language. It is for the most part dry and unadorned, and in
syntax departs occasionally from classical usages, but it is clear,
terse and exact. Technical terms may cause difficulty to the
ordinary reader, but their meaning is always precisely defined;
new compounds are employed whenever the subject requires
them, but the capacities of the language rise to the demands
made upon it; and the conceptions of jurisprudence have never
been more adequately expressed than by the great Romanist
jurists.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LATIN LITERATURE.<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> The germs of an indigenous literature
had existed at an early period in Rome and in the country districts
of Italy, and they have an importance as indicating natural
wants in the Italian race, which were ultimately satisfied by
regular literary forms. The art of writing was first employed
in the service of the state and of religion for books of ritual,
treaties with other states, the laws of the Twelve Tables and the
like. An approach to literature was made in the <i>Annales
Maximi</i>, records of private families, funeral orations and inscriptions
on busts and tombs such as those of the Scipios in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
the Appian Way. In the satisfaction they afforded to the
commemorative and patriotic instincts they anticipated an
office afterwards performed by the national epics and the works
of regular historians. A still nearer approach to literature was
probably made in oratory, as we learn from Cicero that the
famous speech delivered by Appius Claudius Caecus against
concluding peace with Pyrrhus (280 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) was extant in his time.
Appius also published a collection of moral maxims and reflections
in verse. No other name associated with any form of literature
belonging to the pre-literary age has been preserved by tradition.</p>

<p>But it was rather in the chants and litanies of the ancient
religion, such as those of the Salii and the Fratres Arvales, and
the dirges for the dead (<i>neniae</i>), and in certain extemporaneous
effusions, that some germs of a native poetry might have been
detected; and finally in the use of Saturnian verse, a metre of
pure native origin, which by its rapid and lively movement gave
expression to the vivacity and quick apprehension of the Italian
race. This metre was employed in ritual hymns, which seem to
have assumed definite shapes out of the exclamations of a primitive
priesthood engaged in a rude ceremonial dance. It was also
used by a class of bards or itinerant soothsayers known by the
name of <i>vates</i>, of whom the most famous was one Marcius, and
in the &ldquo;Fescennine verses,&rdquo; as sung at harvest-homes and
weddings, which gave expression to the coarse gaiety of the
people and to their strong tendency to personal raillery and satiric
comment. The metre was also employed in commemorative
poems, accompanied with music, which were sung at funeral
banquets in celebration of the exploits and virtues of distinguished
men. These had their origin in the same impulse which
ultimately found its full gratification in Roman history, Roman
epic poetry, and that form of Roman oratory known as <i>laudationes</i>,
and in some of the <i>Odes</i> of Horace. The latest and probably the
most important of these rude and inchoate forms was that of
dramatic <i>saturae</i> (medleys), put together without any regular
plot and consisting apparently of contests of wit and satiric
invective, and perhaps of comments on current events, accompanied
with music (Livy vii. 2). These have a real bearing on
the subsequent development of Latin literature. They prepared
the mind of the people for the reception of regular comedy.
They may have contributed to the formation of the style of
comedy which appears at the very outset much more mature
than that of serious poetry, tragic or epic. They gave the name
and some of the characteristics to that special literary product
of the Roman soil, the <i>satura</i>, addressed to readers, not to
spectators, which ultimately was developed into pure poetic
satire in Lucilius, Horace, Persius and Juvenal, into the prose
and verse miscellany of Varro, and into something approaching
the prose novel in Petronius.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>First Period: from 240 to about 80 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></i></p>

<p>The historical event which brought about the greatest change
in the intellectual condition of the Romans, and thereby exercised
a decisive influence on the whole course of human
culture, was the capture of Tarentum in 272. After
<span class="sidenote">Livius Andronicus.</span>
the capture many Greek slaves were brought to
Rome, and among them the young Livius Andronicus
(<i>c.</i> 284-204), who was employed in teaching Greek in the family
of his master, a member of the Livian gens. From that time to
learn Greek became a regular part of the education of a Roman
noble. The capture of Tarentum was followed by the complete
Romanizing of all southern Italy. Soon after came the first
Punic war, the principal scene of which was Sicily, where, from
common hostility to the Carthaginian, Greek and Roman were
brought into friendly relations, and the Roman armies must have
become familiar with the spectacles and performances of the
Greek theatre. In the year after the war (240), when the armies
had returned and the people were at leisure to enjoy the fruits of
victory, Livius Andronicus substituted at one of the public
festivals a regular drama, translated or adapted from the Greek,
for the musical medleys (<i>saturae</i>) hitherto in use. From this
time dramatic performances became a regular accompaniment
of the public games, and came more and more to encroach on
the older kinds of amusement, such as the chariot races. The
dramatic work of Livius was mainly of educative value. The
same may be said of his translation of the <i>Odyssey</i>, which was
still used as a school-book in the days of Horace, and the religious
hymn which he was called upon to compose in 207 had no high
literary pretensions. He was, however, the first to familiarize
the Romans with the forms of the Greek drama and the Greek
epic, and thus to determine the main lines which Latin literature
followed for more than a century afterwards.</p>

<p>His immediate successor, Cn. Naevius (d. <i>c.</i> 200 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), was not,
like Livius, a Greek, but either a Roman citizen or, more probably,
a Campanian who enjoyed the limited citizenship of a
Latin and who had served in the Roman army in the
<span class="sidenote">Naevius.</span>
first Punic war. His first appearance as a dramatic author was
in 235. He adapted both tragedies and comedies from the
Greek, but the bent of his genius, the tastes of his audience,
and the condition of the language developed through the active
intercourse and business of life, gave a greater impulse to comedy
than to tragedy. Naevius tried to use the theatre, as it had been
used by the writers of the Old Comedy of Athens, for the purposes
of political warfare, and thus seems to have anticipated by a
century the part played by Lucilius. But his attacks upon the
Roman aristocracy, especially the Metelli, were resented by their
objects; and Naevius, after being imprisoned, had to retire in
his old age into banishment. He was not only the first in point
of time, and according to ancient testimony one of the first in
point of merit, among the comic poets of Rome, and in spirit,
though not in form, the earliest of the line of Roman satirists,
but he was also the oldest of the national poets. Besides celebrating
the success of M. Claudius Marcellus in 222 over the Gauls
in a play called <i>Clastidium</i>, he gave the first specimen of the
<i>fabula praetexta</i> in his <i>Alimonium Romuli et Remi</i>, based on the
most national of all Roman traditions. Still more important
service was rendered by him in his long Saturnian poem on the
first Punic war, in which he not only told the story of contemporary
events but gave shape to the legend of the settlement of
Aeneas in Latium,&mdash;the theme ultimately adopted for the great
national epic of Rome.</p>

<p>His younger contemporary T. Maccius Plautus (<i>c.</i> 254-184)
was the greatest comic dramatist of Rome. He lived and wrote
only to amuse his contemporaries, and thus, although
more popular in his lifetime and more fortunate than
<span class="sidenote">Plautus.</span>
any of the older authors in the ultimate survival of a large
number of his works, he is less than any of the great writers of
Rome in sympathy with either the serious or the caustic spirit in
Latin literature. Yet he is the one extant witness to the humour
and vivacity of the Italian temperament at a stage between its
early rudeness and rigidity and its subsequent degeneracy.</p>

<p>Thus far Latin literature, of which the predominant characteristics
are dignity, gravity and fervour of feeling, seemed likely
to become a mere vehicle of amusement adapted to all classes
of the people in their holiday mood. But a new spirit, which
henceforth became predominant, appeared in the time of Plautus.
Latin literature ceased to be in close sympathy with the popular
spirit, either politically or as a form of amusement, but became
the expression of the ideas, sentiment and culture of the aristocratic
<span class="sidenote">Ennius.</span>
governing class. It was by Q. Ennius (239-169)
of Rudiae in Messapia, that a new direction was
given to Latin literature. Deriving from his birthplace the
culture, literary and philosophical, of Magna Graecia, and
having gained the friendship of the greatest of the Romans living
in that great age, he was of all the early writers most fitted to be
the medium of conciliation between the serious genius of ancient
Greece and the serious genius of Rome. Alone among the older
writers he was endowed with the gifts of a poetical imagination
and animated with enthusiasm for a great ideal.</p>

<p>First among his special services to Latin literature was the
fresh impulse which he gave to tragedy. He turned the eyes
of his contemporaries from the commonplace social humours of
later Greek life to the contemplation of the heroic age. But he
did not thereby denationalize the Roman drama. He animated
the heroes of early Greece with the martial spirit of Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span>
soldiers and the ideal magnanimity and sagacity of Roman
senators, and imparted weight and dignity to the language
and verse in which their sentiments and thoughts were expressed.
Although Rome wanted creative force to add a great series of
tragic dramas to the literature of the world, yet the spirit of
elevation and moral authority breathed into tragedy by Ennius
passed into the ethical and didactic writings and the oratory
of a later time.</p>

<p>Another work was the <i>Saturae</i>, written in various metres,
but chiefly in the trochaic tetrameter. He thus became the
inventor of a new form of literature; and, if in his hands the
<i>satura</i> was rude and indeterminate in its scope, it became a
vehicle by which to address a reading public on matters of the
day, or on the materials of his wide reading, in a style not far
removed from the language of common life. His greatest work,
which made the Romans regard him as the father of their literature,
was his epic poem, in eighteen books, the <i>Annales</i>, in which
the record of the whole career of Rome was unrolled with idealizing
enthusiasm and realistic detail. The idea which inspired
Ennius was ultimately realized in both the national epic of
Virgil and the national history of Livy. And the metrical
vehicle which he conceived as the only one adequate to his
great theme was a rude experiment, which was ultimately developed
into the stately Virgilian hexameter. Even as a grammarian
he performed an important service to the literary language
of Rome, by fixing its prosody and arresting the tendency to
decay in its final syllables. Although of his writings only
fragments remain, these fragments are enough, along with what
we know of him from ancient testimony, to justify us in regarding
him as the most important among the makers of Latin literature
before the age of Cicero.</p>

<p>There is still one other name belonging partly to this, partly
to the next generation, to be added to those of the men of original
force of mind and character who created Latin literature,
that of M. Porcius Cato the Censor (234-149),
<span class="sidenote">Cato.</span>
the younger contemporary of Ennius, whom he brought to
Rome. More than Naevius and Plautus he represented the pure
native element in that literature, the mind and character of
Latium, the plebeian pugnacity, which was one of the great
forces in the Roman state. His lack of imagination and his
narrow patriotism made him the natural leader of the reaction
against the new Hellenic culture. He strove to make literature
ancillary to politics and to objects of practical utility, and thus
started prose literature on the chief lines that it afterwards
followed. Through his industry and vigorous understanding
he gave a great impulse to the creation of Roman oratory,
history and systematic didactic writing. He was one of the first
to publish his speeches and thus to bring them into the domain
of literature. Cicero, who speaks of 150 of these speeches as
extant in his day, praises them for their acuteness, their wit,
their conciseness. He speaks with emphasis of the impressiveness
of Cato&rsquo;s eulogy and the satiric bitterness of his
invective.</p>

<p>Cato was the first historical writer of Rome to use his native
tongue. His <i>Origines</i>, the work of his old age, was written with
that thoroughly Roman conception of history which regarded
actions and events solely as they affected the continuous and
progressive life of a state. Cato felt that the record of Roman
glory could not be isolated from the story of the other Italian
communities, which, after fighting against Rome for their own
independence, shared with her the task of conquering the world.
To the wider national sympathies which stimulated the researches
of the old censor into the legendary history of the
Italian towns we owe some of the most truly national parts of
Virgil&rsquo;s <i>Aeneid</i>.</p>

<p>In Naevius, Plautus, Ennius and Cato are represented the
contending forces which strove for ascendancy in determining
what was to be the character of the new literature. The work,
begun by them, was carried on by younger contemporaries and
successors; by Statius Caecilius (<i>c.</i> 220-168), an Insubrian Gaul,
in comedy; in tragedy by M. Pacuvius (<i>c.</i> 220-132), the nephew
of Ennius, called by Cicero the greatest of Roman tragedians;
and, in the following generation, by L. Accius (<i>c.</i> 170-86), who
was more usually placed in this position. The impulse given to
oratory by Cato, Ser. Sulpicius Galba and others, and along with
it the development of prose composition, went on with increased
momentum till the age of Cicero. But the interval between
the death of Ennius (169) and the beginning of Cicero&rsquo;s career,
while one of progressive advance in the appreciation of literary
form and style, was much less distinguished by original force
than the time immediately before and after the end of the
second Punic war. The one complete survival of the generation
after the death of Ennius, the comedy of P. Terentius
<span class="sidenote">Terence.</span>
Afer or Terence (<i>c.</i> 185-159), exemplifies the gain in
literary accomplishment and the loss in literary freedom. Terence
has nothing Roman or Italian except his pure and idiomatic
Latinity. His Athenian elegance affords the strongest contrast
to the Italian rudeness of Cato&rsquo;s <i>De Re Rustica</i>. By looking at
them together we understand how much the comedy of Terence
was able to do to refine and humanize the manners of Rome,
but at the same time what a solvent it was of the discipline
and ideas of the old republic. What makes Terence an important
witness of the culture of his time is that he wrote from
the centre of the Scipionic circle, in which what was most
humane and liberal in Roman statesmanship was combined
with the appreciation of what was most vital in the Greek
thought and literature of the time. The comedies of Terence
may therefore be held to give some indication of the tastes of
Scipio, Laelius and their friends in their youth. The influence
of Panaetius and Polybius was more adapted to their maturity,
when they led the state in war, statesmanship and oratory,
and when the humaner teaching of Stoicism began to enlarge
the sympathies of Roman jurists. But in the last years during
which this circle kept together a new spirit appeared in Roman
politics and a new power in Roman literature,&mdash;the revolutionary
spirit evoked by the Gracchi in opposition to the long-continued
ascendancy of the senate, and the new power of Roman satire,
which was exercised impartially and unsparingly against both
the excesses of the revolutionary spirit and the arrogance and
incompetence of the extreme party among the nobles. Roman
satire, though in form a legitimate development of the indigenous
dramatic <i>satura</i> through the written <i>satura</i> of Ennius and
Pacuvius, is really a birth of this time, and its author was the
youngest of those admitted into the intimacy of the Scipionic
<span class="sidenote">Lucilius.</span>
circle, C. Lucilius of Suessa Aurunca (<i>c.</i> 180-103).
Among the writers before the age of Cicero he alone
deserves to be named with Naevius, Plautus Ennius and Cato
as a great originative force in literature. For about thirty
years the most important event in Roman literature was the
production of the satires of Lucilius, in which the politics, morals,
society and letters of the time were criticized with the utmost
freedom and pungency, and his own personality was brought
immediately and familiarly before his contemporaries. The
years that intervened between his death and the beginning
of the Ciceronian age are singularly barren in works of original
value. But in one direction there was some novelty. The
tragic writers had occasionally taken their subjects from Roman
life (<i>fabulae praetextae</i>), and in comedy we find the corresponding
<i>togatae</i> of Lucius Afranius and others, in which comedy, while
assuming a Roman dress, did not assume the virtue of a Roman
matron.</p>

<p>The general results of the last fifty years of the first period
(130 to 80) may be thus summed up. In poetry we have the
satires of Lucilius, the tragedies of Accius and of a
few successors among the Roman aristocracy, who
<span class="sidenote">General results from 130 to 80.</span>
thus exemplified the affinity of the Roman stage to
Roman oratory; various annalistic poems intended
to serve as continuations of the great poem of Ennius; minor
poems of an epigrammatic and erotic character, unimportant
anticipations of the Alexandrian tendency operative in the
following period; works of criticism in trochaic tetrameters
by Porcius Licinus and others, forming part of the critical and
grammatical movement which almost from the first accompanied
the creative movement in Latin literature, and which may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
regarded as rude precursors of the didactic epistles that Horace
devoted to literary criticism.</p>

<p>The only extant prose work which may be assigned to the end
of this period is the treatise on rhetoric known by the title <i>Ad
Herennium</i> (<i>c.</i> 84) a work indicative of the attention bestowed
on prose style and rhetorical studies during the last century of
the republic, and which may be regarded as a precursor of the
oratorical treatises of Cicero and of the work of Quintilian.
But the great literary product of this period was oratory,
developed indeed with the aid of these rhetorical studies, but
<span class="sidenote">Oratory.</span>
itself the immediate outcome of the imperial interests,
the legal conflicts, and the political passions of that
time of agitation. The speakers and writers of a later age
looked back on Scipio and Laelius, the Gracchi and their contemporaries,
L. Crassus and M. Antonius, as masters of their art.</p>

<p>In history, regarded as a great branch of prose literature,
it is not probable that much was accomplished, although, with
the advance of oratory and grammatical studies,
there must have been not only greater fluency of
<span class="sidenote">History.</span>
composition but the beginning of a richer and more ornate style.
Yet Cicero denies to Rome the existence, before his own time,
of any adequate historical literature. Nevertheless it was by
the work of a number of Roman chroniclers during this period
that the materials of early Roman history were systematized,
and the record of the state, as it was finally given to the world
in the artistic work of Livy, was extracted from the early annals,
state documents and private memorials, combined into a
coherent unity, and supplemented by invention and reflection.
Amongst these chroniclers may be mentioned L. Calpurnius Piso
Frugi (consul 133, censor 108), C. Sempronius Tuditanus
(consul 129), Cn. Gellius, C. Fannius (consul 122), L. Coelius
Antipater, who wrote a narrative of the second Punic war about
120, and Sempronius Asellio, who wrote a history of his own
times, have a better claim to be considered historians. There
were also special works on antiquities and contemporary
memoirs, and autobiographies such as those of M. Aemilius
Scaurus, the elder, Q. Lutatius Catulus (consul 102 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and
P. Rutilius Rufus, which formed the sources of future historians.
(See further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Annales</a></span>; and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rome</a></span>: <i>History</i>, <i>Ancient</i>,
¬ß &ldquo;Authorities.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Although the artistic product of the first period of Latin
literature which has reached us in a complete shape is limited
to the comedies of Plautus and Terence, the influence
of the lost literature in determining the spirit, form
<span class="sidenote">Summary of the period.</span>
and style of the eras of more perfect accomplishment
which followed is unmistakable. While humour and
vivacity characterize the earlier, and urbanity of tone the later
development of comedy, the tendency of serious literature had
been in the main practical, ethical, commemorative and satirical.
The higher poetical imagination had appeared only in Ennius,
and had been called forth in him by sympathy with the grandeur
of the national life and the great personal qualities of its representative
men. Some of the chief motives of the later poetry,
<i>e.g.</i> the pleasures and sorrows of private life, had as yet found
scarcely any expression in Latin literature. The fittest metrical
vehicle for epic, didactic, and satiric poetry had been discovered,
but its movement was as yet rude and inharmonious. The
idiom of ordinary life and social intercourse and the more fervid
and elevated diction of oratorical prose had made great progress,
but the language of imagination and poetical feeling was, if
vivid and impressive in isolated expressions, still incapable of
being wrought into consecutive passages of artistic composition.
The influences of Greek literature to which Latin literature owed
its birth had not as yet spread beyond Rome and Latium. The
Sabellian races of central and eastern Italy and the Italo-Celtic
and Venetian races of the north, in whom the poetic susceptibility
of Italy was most manifest two generations later, were not, until
after the Social war, sufficiently in sympathy with Rome, and
were probably not as yet sufficiently educated to induce them
to contribute their share to the national literature. Hence the
end of the Social war, and of the Civil war, which arose out of it,
is most clearly a determining factor in Roman literature, and
may most appropriately be taken as marking the end of one
period and the beginning of another.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Second Period: from 80 to 42 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></i></p>

<p>The last age of the republic coincides with the first half of the
Golden age of Roman literature. It is generally known as the
Ciceronian age from the name of its greatest literary representative,
whose activity as a <span class="correction" title="amended from peaker">speaker</span> and writer was unremitting
during nearly the whole period. It is the age of purest excellence
in prose, and of a new birth of poetry, characterized rather by
great original force and artistic promise than by perfect accomplishment.
The five chief representatives of this age who still
hold their rank among the great classical writers are Cicero,
Caesar and Sallust in prose, Lucretius and Catullus in verse.
The works of other prose writers, Varro and Cornelius Nepos,
have been partially preserved; but these writers have no claim
to rank with those already mentioned as creators and masters
of literary style. Although literature had not as yet become
a trade or profession, an educated reading public already existed,
and books and intellectual intercourse filled a large part of the
leisure of men actively engaged in affairs. Even oratory was
intended quite as much for readers as for the audiences to which
it was immediately addressed; and some of the greatest speeches
which have come down from that great age of orators were never
delivered at all, but were published as manifestoes after the
event with the view of influencing educated opinion, and as
works of art with the view of giving pleasure to educated taste.</p>

<p>Thus the speeches of M. Tullius Cicero (106-43) belong to the
domain of literature quite as much as to that of forensic or
political oratory. And, although Demosthenes is a
master of style unrivalled even by Cicero, the literary
<span class="sidenote">Cicero.</span>
interest of most of Cicero&rsquo;s speeches is stronger than that of the
great mass of Greek oratory. It is urged with justice that the
greater part of Cicero&rsquo;s <i>Defence of Archias</i> was irrelevant to
the issue and would not have been listened to by a Greek court of
justice or a modern jury. But it was fortunate for the interests
of literature that a court of educated Romans could be influenced
by the considerations there submitted to them. In this way a
question of the most temporary interest, concerning an individual
of no particular eminence or importance, has produced one of
the most impressive vindications of literature ever spoken or
written. Oratory at Rome assumed a new type from being
cultivated as an art which endeavoured to produce persuasion
not so much by intellectual conviction, as by appeal to general
human sympathies. In oratory, as in every other intellectual
province, the Greeks had a truer sense of the limits and conditions
of their art. But command over form is only one element in the
making of an orator or poet. The largeness and dignity of the
matter with which he has to deal are at least as important.
The Roman oratory of the law courts had to deal not with petty
questions of disputed property, of fraud, or violence, but with
great imperial questions, with matters affecting the well-being
of large provinces and the honour and safety of the republic;
and no man ever lived who, in these respects, was better fitted
than Cicero to be the representative of the type of oratory
demanded by the condition of the later republic. To his great
artistic accomplishment, perfected by practice and elaborate
study, to the power of his patriotic, his moral, and personal
sympathies, and his passionate emotional nature, must be added
his vivid imagination and the rich and copious stream of his
language, in which he had no rival among Roman writers or
speakers. It has been said that Roman poetry has produced
few, if any, great types of character. But the Verres, Catiline,
Antony of Cicero are living and permanent types. The story
told in the <i>Pro Cluentio</i> may be true or false, but the picture of
provincial crime which it presents is vividly dramatic. Had
we only known Cicero in his speeches we should have ranked
him with Demosthenes as one who had realized the highest
literary ideal. We should think of him also as the creator and
master of Latin style&mdash;and, moreover, not only as a great orator
but as a just and appreciative critic of oratory. But to his
services to Roman oratory we have to add his services not indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>
to philosophy but to the literature of philosophy. Though not
a philosopher he is an admirable interpreter of those branches of
philosophy which are fitted for practical application, and he
presents us with the results of Greek reflection vivified by his own
human sympathies and his large experience of men. In giving
a model of the style in which human interest can best be imparted
to abstract discussions, he used his great oratorical gift and art
to persuade the world to accept the most hopeful opinions on
human destiny and the principles of conduct most conducive to
elevation and integrity of character.</p>

<p>The <i>Letters</i> of Cicero are thoroughly natural&mdash;<i>colloquia
absentium amicorum</i>, to use his own phrase. Cicero&rsquo;s letters to
Atticus, and to the friends with whom he was completely at his
ease, are the most sincere and immediate expression of the
thought and feeling of the moment. They let us into the secret
of his most serious thoughts and cares, and they give a natural
outlet to his vivacity of observation, his wit and humour, his
kindliness of nature. It shows how flexible an instrument Latin
prose had become in his hand, when it could do justice at once
to the ample and vehement volume of his oratory, to the calmer
and more rhythmical movement of his philosophical meditation,
and to the natural interchange of thought and feeling in the
everyday intercourse of life.</p>

<p>Among the many rival orators of the age the most eminent
were Quintus Hortensius Ortalus and C. Julius Caesar. The
former was the leading representative of the Asiatic
or florid style of oratory, and, like other members of
<span class="sidenote">Caesar.</span>
the aristocracy, such as C. Memmius and L. Manlius Torquatus,
and like Q. Catulus in the preceding generation, was a kind of
dilettante poet and a precursor of the poetry of pleasure, which
attained such prominence in the elegiac poets of the Augustan
age. Of C. Julius Caesar (102-44) as an orator we can judge only
by his reputation and by the testimony of his great rival and
adversary Cicero; but we are able to appreciate the special
praise of perfect taste in the use of language attributed to him.<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
In his <i>Commentaries</i>, by laying aside the ornaments of oratory,
he created the most admirable style of prose narrative, the style
which presents interesting events in their sequence of time and
dependence on the will of the actor, rapidly and vividly, with
scarcely any colouring of personal or moral feeling, any oratorical
passion, any pictorial illustration. While he shows the persuasive
art of an orator by presenting the subjugation of Gaul and his own
action in the Civil War in the light most favourable to his claim
to rule the Roman world, he is entirely free from the Roman
fashion of self-laudation or disparagement of an adversary.
The character of the man reveals itself especially in a perfect
simplicity of style, the result of the clearest intelligence and the
strongest sense of personal dignity. He avoids not only every
unusual but every superfluous word; and, although no writing
can be more free from rhetorical colouring, yet there may from
time to time be detected a glow of sympathy, like the glow of
generous passion in Thucydides, the more effective from the
reserve with which it betrays itself whenever he is called on to
record any act of personal heroism or of devotion to military duty.</p>

<p>In the simplicity of his style, the directness of his narrative,
the entire absence of any didactic tendency, Caesar presents a
marked contrast to another prose writer of that age&mdash;the
historian C. Sallustius Crispus or Sallust (<i>c</i>. 87-36).
<span class="sidenote">Sallust.</span>
Like Varro, he survived Cicero by some years, but the tone and
spirit in which his works are written assign him to the republican
era. He was the first of the purely artistic historians, as distinct
from the annalists and the writers of personal memoirs. He
imitated the Greek historians in taking particular actions&mdash;the
<i>Jugurthan War</i> and the <i>Catilinarian Conspiracy</i>&mdash;as the subjects
of artistic treatment. He wrote also a continuous work, <i>Historiae</i>,
treating of the events of the twelve years following the death of
Sulla, of which only fragments are preserved. His two extant
works are more valuable as artistic studies of the rival parties in
the state and of personal character than as trustworthy narratives
of facts. His style aims at effectiveness by pregnant expression,
sententiousness, archaism. He produces the impression of
caring more for the manner of saying a thing than for its truth.
Yet he has great value as a painter of historical portraits, some of
them those of his contemporaries, and as an author who had been
a political partisan and had taken some part in making history
before undertaking to write it; and he gives us, from the popular
side, the views of a contemporary on the politics of the time.
Of the other historians, or rather annalists, who belong to this
period, such as Q. Claudius Quadrigarius, Q. Valerius Antias,
and C. Licinius Macer, the father of Calvus, we have only fragments
remaining.</p>

<p>The period was also remarkable for the production of works
which we should class as technical or scientific rather than
literary. The activity of one of these writers was so
great that he is entitled to a separate mention. This
<span class="sidenote">Varro.</span>
was M. Terentius Varro, the most learned not only of the Romans
but of the Greeks, as he has been called. The list of Varro&rsquo;s
writings includes over seventy treatises and more than six
hundred books dealing with topics of every conceivable kind.
His <i>Menippeae Saturae</i>, miscellanies in prose and verse, of which
unfortunately only fragments are left, was a work of singular
literary interest.</p>

<p>Since the <i>Annals</i> of Ennius no great and original poem had
appeared. The powerful poetical force which for half a century
continued to be the strongest force in literature, and
which created masterpieces of art and genius, first
<span class="sidenote">Lucretius.</span>
revealed itself in the latter part of the Ciceronian age. The
conditions which enabled the poetic genius of Italy to come to
maturity in the person of T. Lucretius Carus (96-55) were entire
seclusion from public life and absorption in the ideal pleasures
of contemplation and artistic production. This isolation from
the familiar ways of his contemporaries, while it was, according
to tradition and the internal evidence of his poem, destructive
to his spirit&rsquo;s health, resulted in a work of genius, unique in
character, which still stands forth as the greatest philosophical
poem in any language. In the form of his poem he followed a
Greek original; and the stuff out of which the texture of his
philosophical argument is framed was derived from Greek
science; but all that is of deep human and poetical meaning in
the poem is his own. While we recognize in the <i>De Rerum
Natura</i> some of the most powerful poetry in any language and
feel that few poets have penetrated with such passionate sincerity
and courage into the secret of nature and some of the deeper
truths of human life, we must acknowledge that, as compared
with the great didactic poem of Virgil, it is crude and unformed
in artistic design, and often rough and unequal in artistic execution.
Yet, apart altogether from its independent value, by his
speculative power and enthusiasm, by his revelation of the life
and spectacle of nature, by the fresh creativeness of his diction
and the elevated movement of his rhythm, Lucretius exercised
a more powerful influence than any other on the art of his more
perfect successors.</p>

<p>While the imaginative and emotional side of Roman poetry
was so powerfully represented by Lucretius, attention was
directed to its artistic side by a younger generation,
who moulded themselves in a great degree on
<span class="sidenote">Catullus.</span>
Alexandrian models. Such were Valerius Cato also a distinguished
literary critic, and C. Licinius Calvus, an eminent
orator. Of this small group of poets one only has survived,
fortunately the man of most genius among them, the bosom-friend
of Calvus, C. Valerius Catullus (84-54). He too was a
new force in Roman literature. He was a provincial by birth,
although early brought into intimate relations with members of
the great Roman families. The subjects of his best art are
taken immediately from his own life&mdash;his loves, his friendships,
his travels, his animosities, personal and political. His most
original contribution to the substance of Roman literature was
that he first shaped into poetry the experience of his own heart,
as it had been shaped by Alcaeus and Sappho in the early days
of Greek poetry. No poet has surpassed him in the power of
vitally reproducing the pleasure and pain of the passing hour, not
recalled by idealizing reflection as in Horace, nor overlaid with
mythological ornament as in Propertius, but in all the keenness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
of immediate impression. He also introduced into Roman
literature that personal as distinct from political or social satire
which appears later in the <i>Epodes</i> of Horace and the <i>Epigrams</i>
of Martial. He anticipated Ovid in recalling the stories of Greek
mythology to a second poetical life. His greatest contribution to
poetic art consisted in the perfection which he attained in the
phalaecian, the pure iambic, and the scazon metres, and in the
ease and grace with which he used the language of familiar
intercourse, as distinct from that of the creative imagination,
of the <i>rostra</i>, and of the schools, to give at once a lifelike and an
artistic expression to his feelings. He has the interest of being
the last poet of the free republic. In his life and in his art he
was the precursor of those poets who used their genius as the
interpreter and minister of pleasure; but he rises above them
in the spirit of personal independence, in his affection for his
friends, in his keen enjoyment of natural and simple pleasures,
and in his power of giving vital expression to these feelings.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Third Period: Augustan Age, 42 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 17.</i></p>

<p>The poetic impulse and culture communicated to Roman
literature in the last years of the republic passed on without
any break of continuity into the literature of the
succeeding age. One or two of the circle of Catullus
<span class="sidenote">Influence of imperial institutions.</span>
survived into that age; but an entirely new spirit
came over the literature of the new period, and it is
by new men, educated indeed under the same literary influences,
but living in an altered world and belonging originally to a
different order in the state, that the new spirit was expressed.
The literature of the later republic reflects the sympathies and
prejudices of an aristocratic class, sharing in the conduct of
national affairs and living on terms of equality with one another;
that of the Augustan age, first in its early serious enthusiasm,
and then in the licence and levity of its later development,
represents the hopes and aspirations with which the new monarchy
was ushered into the world, and the pursuit of pleasure
and amusement, which becomes the chief interest of a class cut
off from the higher energies of practical life, and moving in the
refining and enervating atmosphere of an imperial court. The
great inspiring influence of the new literature was the enthusiasm
produced first by the hope and afterwards by the fulfilment
of the restoration of peace, order, national glory, under the rule
of Augustus. All that the age longed for seemed to be embodied
in a man who had both in his own person and by inheritance
the natural spell which sways the imagination of the world.
The sentiment of hero-worship was at all times strong in the
Romans, and no one was ever the object of more sincere as
well as simulated hero-worship than Augustus. It was not,
however, by his equals in station that the first feeling was likely
to be entertained. The earliest to give expression to it was
Virgil; but the spell was soon acknowledged by the colder
and more worldly-wise Horace. The disgust aroused by the
anti-national policy of Antony, and the danger to the empire
which was averted by the result of the battle of Actium, combined
with the confidence inspired by the new ruler to reconcile
the great families as well as the great body of the people to the
new order of things.</p>

<p>While the establishment of the empire produced a revival
of national and imperial feeling, it suppressed all independent
political thought and action. Hence the two great forms of
prose literature which drew their nourishment from the struggles
of political life, oratory and contemporary history, were arrested
in their development. The main course of literature was thus
for a time diverted into poetry. That poetry in its most elevated
form aimed at being the organ of the new empire and of realizing
the national ideals of life and character under its auspices;
and in carrying out this aim it sought to recall the great memories
of the past. It became also the organ of the pleasures and
interests of private life, the chief motives of which were the
love of nature and the passion of love. It sought also to make
the art and poetry of Greece live a new artistic life. Satire,
debarred from comment on political action, turned to social
and individual life, and combined with the newly-developed
taste for ethical analysis and reflection introduced by Cicero.
One great work had still to be done in prose&mdash;a retrospect of
the past history of the state from an idealizing and romanticizing
point of view. For that work the Augustan age, as the end of
one great cycle of events and the beginning of another, was
eminently suited, and a writer who, by his gifts of imagination
and sympathy, was perhaps better fitted than any other man
of antiquity for the task, and who through the whole of this
period lived a life of literary leisure, was found to do justice to
the subject.</p>

<p>Although the age did not afford free scope and stimulus to
individual energy and enterprise, it furnished more material
and social advantages for the peaceful cultivation of letters.
The new influence of patronage, which in other times has chilled
the genial current of literature, become, in the person of Maecenas,
the medium through which literature and the imperial policy
were brought into union. Poetry thus acquired the tone of the
world, kept in close connexion with the chief source of national
life, while it was cultivated to the highest pitch of artistic perfection
under the most favourable conditions of leisure and
freedom from the distractions and anxieties of life.</p>

<p>The earliest in the order of time of the poets who adorn this
age&mdash;P. Vergilius Maro or Virgil (70-19)&mdash;is also the greatest
in genius, the most richly cultivated, and the most
perfect in art. He is the idealizing poet of the hopes
<span class="sidenote">Virgil.</span>
and aspirations and of the purer and happier life of which the
age seemed to contain the promise. He elevates the present
by associating it with the past and future of the world, and
sanctifies it by seeing in it the fulfilment of a divine purpose.
Virgil is the true representative poet of Rome and Italy, of
national glory and of the beauty of nature, the artist in whom
all the efforts of the past were made perfect, and the unapproachable
standard of excellence to future times. While more richly
endowed with sensibility to all native influences, he was more
deeply imbued than any of his contemporaries with the poetry,
the thought and the learning of Greece. The earliest efforts
of his art (the <i>Eclogues</i>) reproduce the cadences, the diction
and the pastoral fancies of Theocritus; but even in these imitative
poems of his youth Virgil shows a perfect mastery of his
materials. The Latin hexameter, which in Ennius and Lucretius
was the organ of the more dignified and majestic emotions,
became in his hands the most perfect measure in which the
softer and more luxurious sentiment of nature has been expressed.
The sentiment of Italian scenery and the love which
the Italian peasant has for the familiar sights and sounds of his
home found a voice which never can pass away.</p>

<p>In the <i>Georgics</i> we are struck by the great advance in the
originality and self-dependence of the artist, in the mature
perfection of his workmanship, in the deepening and strengthening
of all his sympathies and convictions. His genius still works
under forms prescribed by Greek art, and under the disadvantage
of having a practical and utilitarian aim imposed on it. But
he has ever in form so far surpassed his originals that he alone
has gained for the pure didactic poem a place among the highest
forms of serious poetry, while he has so transmuted his material
that, without violation of truth, he has made the whole poem
alive with poetic feeling. The homeliest details of the farmer&rsquo;s
work are transfigured through the poet&rsquo;s love of nature; through
his religious feeling and his pious sympathy with the sanctities
of human affection; through his patriotic sympathy with the
national greatness; and through the rich allusiveness of his
art to everything in poetry and legend which can illustrate and
glorify his theme.</p>

<p>In the <i>Eclogues</i> and <i>Georgics</i> Virgil is the idealizing poet of
the old simple and hardy life of Italy, as the imagination could
conceive of it in an altered world. In the <i>Aeneid</i> he is the
idealizing poet of national glory, as manifested in the person of
Augustus. The epic of national life, vividly conceived but
rudely executed by Ennius, was perfected in the years that
followed the decisive victory at Actium. To do justice to his
idea Virgil enters into rivalry with a greater poet than those
whom he had equalled or surpassed in his previous works. And,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>
though he cannot unroll before us the page of heroic action with
the power and majesty of Homer, yet by the sympathy with
which he realizes the idea of Rome, and by the power with which
he has used the details of tradition, of local scenes, of religious
usage, to embody it, he has built up in the form of an epic
poem the most enduring and the most artistically constructed
monument of national grandeur.</p>

<p>The second great poet of the time&mdash;Q. Horatius Flaccus or
Horace (68-8) is both the realist and the idealist of his age. If
we want to know the actual lives, manners and ways
of thinking of the Romans of the generation succeeding
<span class="sidenote">Horace.</span>
the overthrow of the republic it is in the <i>Satires</i> and partially in
the <i>Epistles</i> of Horace that we shall find them. If we ask what
that time provided to stir the fancy and move the mood of
imaginative reflection, it is in the lyrical poems of Horace that
we shall find the most varied and trustworthy answer. His
literary activity extends over about thirty years and naturally
divides itself into three periods, each marked by a distinct
character. The first&mdash;extending from about 40 to 29&mdash;is that of
the <i>Epodes</i> and <i>Satires</i>. In the former he imitates the Greek poet
Archilochus, but takes his subjects from the men, women and
incidents of the day. Personality is the essence of his <i>Epodes</i>; in
the <i>Satires</i> it is used merely as illustrative of general tendencies.
In the <i>Satires</i> we find realistic pictures of social life, and the
conduct and opinions of the world submitted to the standard of
good feeling and common sense. The style of the <i>Epodes</i> is
pointed and epigrammatic, that of the <i>Satires</i> natural and
familiar. The hexameter no longer, as in Lucilius, moves awkwardly
as if in fetters, but, like the language of Terence, of
Catullus in his lighter pieces, of Cicero in his letters to Atticus,
adapts itself to the everyday intercourse of life. The next period
is the meridian of his genius, the time of his greatest lyrical
inspiration, which he himself associates with the peace and
leisure secured to him by his Sabine farm. The life of pleasure
which he had lived in his youth comes back to him, not as it was
in its actual distractions and disappointments, but in the idealizing
light of meditative retrospect. He had not only become
reconciled to the new order of things, but was moved by his
intimate friendship with Maecenas to aid in raising the world
to sympathy with the imperial rule through the medium of his
lyrical inspiration, as Virgil had through the glory of his epic art.
With the completion of the three books of <i>Odes</i> he cast aside for
a time the office of the <i>vates</i>, and resumed that of the critical spectator
of human life, but in the spirit of a moralist rather than a
satirist. He feels the increasing languor of the time as well as the
languor of advancing years, and seeks to encourage younger men
to take up the r√¥le of lyrical poetry, while he devotes himself to
the contemplation of the true art of living. Self-culture rather
than the fulfilment of public or social duty, as in the moral
teaching of Cicero, is the aim of his teaching; and in this we
recognize the influence of the empire in throwing the individual
back on himself. As Cicero tones down his oratory in his moral
treatises, so Horace tones down the fervour of his lyrical utterances
in his <i>Epistles</i>, and thus produces a style combining the ease
of the best epistolary style with the grace and concentration of
poetry&mdash;the style, as it has been called, of &ldquo;idealized common
sense,&rdquo; that of the <i>urbanus</i> and cultivated man of the world who
is also in his hours of inspiration a genuine poet. In the last
ten years of his life Horace resumed his lyrical function for a
time, under pressure of the imperial command, and produced
some of the most exquisite and mature products of his art.
But his chief activity is devoted to criticism. He first vindicates
the claims of his own age to literary pre-eminence, and then seeks
to stimulate the younger writers of the day to what he regarded
as the manlier forms of poetry, and especially to the tragic
drama, which seemed for a short time to give promise of an
artistic revival.</p>

<p>But the poetry of the latter half of the Augustan age destined
to survive did not follow the lines either of lyrical or of dramatic
art marked out by Horace. The latest form of poetry adopted
from Greece and destined to gain and permanently to hold the ear
of the world was the <i>elegy</i>. From the time of Mimnermus this
form seems to have presented itself as the most natural vehicle
for the poetry of pleasure in an age of luxury, refinement and
incipient decay. Its facile flow and rhythm seem to adapt it
to the expression and illustration of personal feeling. It goes to
the mind of the reader through a medium of sentiment rather
than of continuous thought or imaginative illustration. The
greatest masters of this kind of poetry are the elegiac poets of
the Augustan age&mdash;Tibullus, Propertius and Ovid.</p>

<p>Of the ill-fated C. Cornelius Gallus, their predecessor, we have
but a single pentameter remaining. Of the three Tibullus
(<i>c.</i> 54-19) is the most refined and tender. As the poet
of love he gives utterance to the pensive melancholy
<span class="sidenote">Tibullus]</span>
rather than to the pleasures associated with it. In his sympathy
with the life and beliefs of the country people he shows an affinity
both to the idyllic spirit and to the piety of Virgil. There is
something, too, in his fastidious refinement and in his shrinking
from the rough contact of life that reminds us of the English
poet Gray.</p>

<p>A poet of more strength and more powerful imagination, but
of less refinement in his life and less exquisite taste in his art,
is Sextus Propertius (<i>c.</i> 50-<i>c.</i> 15). His youth was a
more stormy one than that of Tibullus, and was
<span class="sidenote">Propertius.</span>
passed, not like his, among the &ldquo;healthy woods&rdquo; of his
country estate, but amid all the licence of the capital. His
passion for Cynthia, the theme of his most finished poetry, is
second only in interest to that of Catullus for Lesbia; and
Cynthia in her fascination and caprices seems a more real and
intelligible personage than the idealized object first of the
idolatry and afterwards of the malediction of Catullus. Propertius
is a less accomplished artist and a less equably pleasing
writer than either Tibullus or Ovid, but he shows more power
of dealing gravely with a great or tragic situation than either of
them, and his diction and rhythm give frequent proof of a
concentrated force of conception and a corresponding movement
of imaginative feeling which remind us of Lucretius.</p>

<p>The most facile and brilliant of the elegiac poets and the
least serious in tone and spirit is P. Ovidius Naso or Ovid
(43 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>-<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 18). As an amatory poet he is the poet of pleasure
and intrigue rather than of tender sentiment or
<span class="sidenote">Ovid.</span>
absorbing passion. Though he treated his subject in relation to
himself with more levity and irony than real feeling, yet by his
sparkling wit and fancy he created a literature of sentiment and
adventure adapted to amuse the idle and luxurious society of
which the elder Julia was the centre. His power of continuous
narrative is best seen in the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, written in hexameters
to which he has imparted a rapidity and precision of movement
more suited to romantic and picturesque narrative than the
weighty self-restrained verse of Virgil. In his <i>Fasti</i> he treats a
subject of national interest; it is not, however, through the
strength of Roman sentiment but through the power of vividly
conceiving and narrating stories of strong human interest that
the poem lives. In his latest works&mdash;the <i>Tristia</i> and <i>Ex Ponto</i>&mdash;he
imparts the interest of personal confessions to the record of
a unique experience. Latin poetry is more rich in the expression
of personal feeling than of dramatic realism. In Ovid we have
both. We know him in the intense liveliness of his feeling and the
human weakness of his nature more intimately than any other
writer of antiquity, except perhaps Cicero. As Virgil marks the
point of maturest excellence in poetic diction and rhythm, Ovid
marks that of the greatest facility.</p>

<p>The Augustan age was one of those great eras in the world
like the era succeeding the Persian War in Greece, the Elizabethan
age in England, and the beginning of the 19th
century in Europe, in which what seems a new spring
<span class="sidenote">Livy.</span>
of national and individual life calls out an idealizing retrospect
of the past. As the present seems full of new life, the past seems
rich in glory and the future in hope. The past of Rome had
always a peculiar fascination for Roman writers. Virgil in a
supreme degree, and Horace, Propertius and Ovid in a less
degree, had expressed in their poetry the romance of the past.
But it was in the great historical work of T. Livius or Livy
(59 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>-<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 17) that the record of the national life received its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>
most systematic exposition. Its execution was the work of a life
prolonged through the languor and dissolution following so soon
upon the promise of the new era, during which time the past
became glorified by contrast with the disheartening aspect of
the present. The value of the work consists not in any power
of critical investigation or weighing of historical evidence but in
the intense sympathy of the writer with the national ideal, and
the vivid imagination with which under the influence of this
sympathy he gives life to the events and personages, the wars
and political struggles, of times remote from his own. He makes
us feel more than any one the majesty of the Roman state, of its
great magistracies, and of the august council by which its policy
was guided. And, while he makes the words <i>senatus populusque
Romanus</i> full of significance for all times, no one realizes with
more enthusiasm all that is implied in the words <i>imperium
Romanum</i>, and the great military qualities of head and heart by
which that empire was acquired and maintained. The vast scale
on which the work was conceived and the thoroughness of artistic
execution with which the details are finished are characteristically
Roman. The prose style of Rome, as a vehicle for the continuous
narration of events coloured by a rich and picturesque imagination
and instinct with dignified emotion, attained its perfection
in Livy.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Fourth Period: The Silver Age, from <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 17 to about 130</i>.</p>

<p>For more than a century after the death of Augustus Roman
literature continues to flow in the old channels. Though drawing
from the provinces, Rome remains the centre of the
literary movement. The characteristics of the great
<span class="sidenote">Characteristics of post-Augustan age.</span>
writers are essentially national, not provincial nor
cosmopolitan. In prose the old forms&mdash;oratory,
history, the epistle, treatises or dialogues on ethical
and literary questions&mdash;continue to be cultivated. Scientific
and practical subjects, such as natural history, architecture,
medicine, agriculture, are treated in more elaborate literary style.
The old Roman <i>satura</i> is developed into something like the
modern prose novel. In the various provinces of poetry, while
there is little novelty or inspiration, there is abundance of industry
and ambitious effort. The national love of works of large
compass shows itself in the production of long epic poems, both
of the historic and of the imitative Alexandrian type. The
imitative and rhetorical tastes of Rome showed themselves
in the composition of exotic tragedies, as remote in spirit and
character from Greek as from Roman life, of which the only
extant specimens are those attributed to the younger Seneca.
The composition of didactic, lyrical and elegiac poetry also was
the accomplishment and pastime of an educated dilettante class,
the only extant specimens of any interest being some of the
<i>Silvae</i> of Statius. The only voice with which the poet of this
age can express himself with force and sincerity is that of satire
and satiric epigram. We find now only imitative echoes of the old
music created by Virgil and others, as in Statius, or powerful
declamation, as in Lucan and Juvenal. There is a deterioration
in the diction as well as in the music of poetry. The elaborate
literary culture of the Augustan age has done something to
impair the native force of the Latin idiom. The language of
literature, in the most elaborate kind of prose as well as poetry,
loses all ring of popular speech. The old oratorical tastes and
aptitudes find their outlet in public recitations and the practice of
declamation. Forced and distorted expression, exaggerated
emphasis, point and antithesis, an affected prettiness, are studied
with the view of gaining the applause of audiences who thronged
the lecture and recitation rooms in search of temporary excitement.
Education is more widely diffused, but is less thorough,
less leisurely in its method, derived less than before from the
purer sources of culture. The precocious immaturity of Lucan&rsquo;s
career affords a marked contrast to the long preparation of
Virgil and Horace for their high office. Although there are some
works of this so-called Silver Age of considerable and one at
least of supreme interest, from the insight they afford into the
experience of a century of organized despotism and its effect on
the spiritual life of the ancient world, it cannot be doubted that
the steady literary decline which characterized the last centuries
of paganism was beginning before the death of Ovid and Livy.</p>

<p>The influences which had inspired republican and Augustan
literature were the artistic impulse derived from a familiarity
with the great works of Greek genius, becoming more intimate
with every new generation, the spell of Rome over the imagination
of the kindred Italian races, the charm of Italy, and the
vivid sensibility of the Italian temperament. These influences
were certainly much less operative in the first century of the
empire. The imitative impulse, which had much of the character
of a creative impulse, and had resulted in the appropriation of
the forms of poetry suited to the Roman and Italian character
and of the metres suited to the genius of the Latin language, no
longer stimulated to artistic effort. The great sources of Greek
poetry were no longer regarded, as they were by Lucretius and
Virgil, as sacred, untasted springs, to be approached in a spirit
of enthusiasm tempered with reverence. We have the testimony
of two men of shrewd common sense and masculine understanding&mdash;Martial
and Juvenal&mdash;to the stale and lifeless character of the
art of the Silver Age, which sought to reproduce in the form of
epics, tragedies and elegies the bright fancies of the Greek
mythology.</p>

<p>The idea of Rome, owing to the antagonism between the policy
of the government and the sympathies of the class by which
literature was favoured and cultivated, could no longer be an
inspiring motive, as it had been in the literature of the republic
and of the Augustan age. The spirit of Rome appears only as
animating the protest of Lucan, the satire of Persius and Juvenal,
the sombre picture which Tacitus paints of the annals of the
empire. Oratory is no longer an independent voice appealing to
sentiments of Roman dignity, but the weapon of the &ldquo;informers&rdquo;
(<i>delatores</i>), wielded for their own advancement and the destruction
of that class which, even in their degeneracy, retained most
sympathy with the national traditions. Roman history was no
longer a record of national glory, stimulating the patriotism and
flattering the pride of all Roman citizens, but a personal eulogy
or a personal invective, according as servility to a present or
hatred of a recent ruler was the motive which animated it.</p>

<p>The charm of Italian scenes still remained the same, but the
fresh and inspiring feeling cf nature gave place to the mere
sensuous gratification derived from the luxurious and artificial
beauty of the country villa. The idealizing poetry of passion,
which found a genuine voice in Catullus and the elegiac poets,
could not prolong itself through the exhausting licence of successive
generations. The vigorous vitality which gives interest
to the personality of Catullus, Propertius and Ovid no longer
characterizes their successors. The pathos of natural affection
is occasionally recognized in Statius and more rarely in Martial,
but it has not the depth of tenderness found in Lucretius and
Virgil. The wealth and luxury of successive generations, the
monotonous routine of life, the separation of the educated
class from the higher work of the world, have produced their
enervating and paralysing effect on the mainsprings of poetic
and imaginative feeling.</p>

<p>New elements, however, appear in the literature of this period.
As the result of the severance from the active interests of life,
a new interest is awakened in the inner life of the
individual. The immorality of Roman society not
<span class="sidenote">New literary elements.</span>
only affords abundant material to the satirist, but
deepens the consciousness of moral evil in purer and
more thoughtful minds. To these causes we attribute the pathological
observation of Seneca and Tacitus, the new sense of
purity in Persius called out by contrast with the impurity
around him, the glowing if somewhat sensational exaggeration
of Juvenal, the vivid characterization of Martial. The literature
of no time presents so powerfully the contrast between moral
good and evil. In this respect it is truly representative of the
life of the age. Another new element is the influence of a new
race. In the two preceding periods the rapid diffusion of literary
culture following the Social War and the first Civil War was seen
to awaken into new life the elements of original genius in Italy
and Cisalpine Gaul. In the first century of the empire a similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
result was produced by the diffusion of that culture in the
Latinized districts of Spain. The fervid temperament of a fresh
and vigorous race, which received the Latin discipline just as
Latium had two or three centuries previously received the
Greek discipline, revealed itself in the writings of the Senecas,
Lucan, Quintilian, Martial and others, who in their own time
added literary distinction to the Spanish towns from which
they came. The new extraneous element introduced into
Roman literature draws into greater prominence the characteristics
of the last great representatives of the genuine Roman
and Italian spirit&mdash;the historian Tacitus and the satirist Juvenal.</p>

<p>On the whole this century shows, in form, language and
substance, the signs of literary decay. But it is still capable
of producing men of original force; it still maintains the traditions
of a happier time; it is still alive to the value of literary
culture, and endeavours by minute attention to style to produce
new effects. Though it was not one of the great eras in the annals
of literature, yet the century which produced Martial, Juvenal
and Tacitus cannot be pronounced barren in literary originality,
nor that which produced Seneca and Quintilian devoid of culture
and literary taste.</p>

<p>This fourth period is itself subdivided into three divisions:
(1) from the accession of Tiberius to the death of Nero, 68&mdash;the
most important part of it being the Neronian age, 54 to 68;
(2) the Flavian era, from the death of Nero to the death of
Domitian, 96; (3) the reigns of Nerva and Trajan and part of
the reign of Hadrian.</p>

<p>1. For a generation after the death of Augustus no new
original literary force appeared. The later poetry of the Augustan
age had ended in trifling dilettantism, for the
continuance of which the atmosphere of the court
<span class="sidenote">Period from Tiberius to Nero.</span>
was no longer favourable. The class by which literature
was encouraged had become both enervated and
terrorized. The most remarkable poetical product of the time is
the long-neglected astrological poem of Manilius which was
written at the beginning of Tiberius&rsquo;s reign. Its vigour and
originality have had scanty justice done to them owing to the
difficulty of the subject-matter and the style, and the corruptions
which still disfigure its text. Very different has been the fate
of the <i>Fables</i> of Phaedrus. This slight work of a Macedonian
freedman, destitute of national significance and representative
in its morality only of the spirit of cosmopolitan individualism,
owes its vogue to its easy Latinity and popular subject-matter.
Of the prose writers C. Velleius Paterculus, the historian, and
Valerius Maximus, the collector of anecdotes, are the most
important. A. Cornelius Celsus composed a series of technical
handbooks, one of which, upon medicine, has survived. Its
purity of style and the fact that it was long a standard work
entitle it to a mention here. The traditional culture was still,
however, maintained, and the age was rich in grammarians and
rhetoricians. The new profession of the <i>delator</i> must have given
a stimulus to oratory. A high ideal of culture, literary as well
as practical, was realized in Germanicus, which seems to have
been transmitted to his daughter Agrippina, whose patronage of
Seneca had important results in the next generation. The reign
of Claudius was a time in which antiquarian learning, grammatical
studies, and jurisprudence were cultivated, but no
important additions were made to literature. A fresh impulse
was given to letters on the accession of Nero, and this was partly
due to the theatrical and artistic tastes of the young emperor.
Four writers of the Neronian age still possess considerable
interest,&mdash;L. Annaeus Seneca, M. Annaeus Lucanus, A. Persius
Flaccus and Petronius Arbiter. The first three represent the
spirit of their age by exhibiting the power of the Stoic philosophy
as a moral, political and religious force; the last is the most
cynical exponent of the depravity of the time. Seneca (<i>c.</i> 5 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>-<span class="scs">A.D.</span>
65) is less than Persius a pure Stoic, and more of a
moralist and pathological observer of man&rsquo;s inner life. He makes
the commonplaces of a cosmopolitan philosophy interesting
by his abundant illustration drawn from the private and social
life of his contemporaries. He has knowledge of the world,
the suppleness of a courtier, Spanish vivacity, and the <i>ingenium
amoenum</i> attributed to him by Tacitus, the fruit of which is
sometimes seen in the &ldquo;honeyed phrases&rdquo; mentioned by
Petronius&mdash;pure aspirations combined with inconsistency of
purpose&mdash;the inconsistency of one who tries to make the best
of two worlds, the ideal inner life and the successful real life
in the atmosphere of a most corrupt court. The <i>Pharsalia</i> of
Lucan (39-65), with Cato as its hero, is essentially a Stoic manifesto
of the opposition. It is written with the force and fervour
of extreme youth and with the literary ambition of a race as
yet new to the discipline of intellectual culture, and is characterized
by rhetorical rather than poetical imagination. The
six short <i>Satires</i> of Persius (34-62) are the purest product of
Stoicism&mdash;a Stoicism that had found in a contemporary, Thrasea,
a more rational and practical hero than Cato. But no important
writer of antiquity has less literary charm than Persius. In
avoiding the literary conceits and fopperies which he satirizes
he has recourse to the most unnatural contortions of expression.
Of hardly greater length are the seven eclogues of T. Calpurnius
Siculus, written at the beginning of the reign of Nero, which
are not without grace and facility of diction. Of the works
of the time that which from a human point of view is perhaps
the most detestable in ancient literature has the most genuine
literary quality, the fragment of a prose novel&mdash;the <i>Satyricon</i>&mdash;of
Petronius (d. 66). It is most sincere in its representation,
least artificial in diction, most penetrating in its satire, most
just in its criticism of art and style.</p>

<p>2. A greater sobriety of tone was introduced both into life
and literature with the accession of Vespasian. The time was,
however, characterized rather by good sense and
industry than by original genius. Under Vespasian
<span class="sidenote">Age of Domitian.</span>
C. Plinius Secundus, or Pliny the elder (compiler of the
<i>Natural History</i>, an encyclopaedic treatise, 23-79),
is the most important prose writer, and C. Valerius Flaccus
Setinus Balbus, author of the <i>Argonautica</i> (d. <i>c</i>. 90), the most
important among the writers of poetry. The reign of Domitian,
although it silenced the more independent spirits of the time,
Tacitus and Juvenal, witnessed more important contributions
to Roman literature than any age since the Augustan,&mdash;among
them the <i>Institutes</i> of Quintilian, the <i>Punic War</i> of Silius Italicus,
the epics and the <i>Silvae</i> of Statius, and the <i>Epigrams</i> of Martial.
M. Fabius Quintilianus, or Quintilian (<i>c.</i> 35-95), is brought forward
by Juvenal as a unique instance of a thoroughly successful
man of letters, of one not belonging by birth to the rich or official
class, who had risen to wealth and honours through literature.
He was well adapted to his time by his good sense and sobriety
of judgment. His criticism is just and true rather than subtle
or ingenious, and has thus stood the test of the judgment of
after-times. The poem of Ti. Catius Silius Italicus (25-101)
is a proof of the industry and literary ambition of members
of the rich official class. Of the epic poets of the Silver Age
P. Papinius Statius (<i>c.</i> 45-96) shows the greatest technical
skill and the richest pictorial fancy in the execution of detail;
but his epics have no true inspiring motive, and, although the
recitation of the <i>Thebaid</i> could attract and charm an audience
in the days of Juvenal, it really belongs to the class of poems
so unsparingly condemned both by him and Martial. In the
<i>Silvae</i>, though many of them have little root in the deeper
feelings of human nature, we find occasionally more than in
any poetry after the Augustan age something of the purer
charm and pathos of life. But it is not in the <i>Silvae</i>, nor in the
epics and tragedies of the time, nor in the cultivated criticism
of Quintilian that the age of Domitian lives for us. It is in the
<i>Epigrams</i> of M. Valerius Martialis or Martial (<i>c</i>. 41-104) that
we have a true image of the average sensual frivolous life of
Rome at the end of the 1st century, seen through a medium
of wit and humour, but undistorted by the exaggeration which
moral indignation and the love of effect add to the representation
of Juvenal. Martial represents his age in his <i>Epigrams</i>, as
Horace does his in his <i>Satires</i> and <i>Odes</i>, with more variety and
incisive force in his sketches, though with much less poetic
charm and serious meaning. We know the daily life, the familiar
personages, the outward aspect of Rome in the age of Domitian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>
better than at any other period of Roman history, and this
knowledge we owe to Martial.</p>

<p>3. But it was under Nerva and Trajan that the greatest and
most truly representative works of the empire were written.
The <i>Annals</i> and <i>Histories</i> of Cornelius Tacitus (54-119),
with the supplementary <i>Life of Agricola</i> and the
<span class="sidenote">Period of Nerva, Trajan and Hadrian.</span>
<i>Germania</i>, and the <i>Satires</i> of D. Iunius Iuvenalis or
Juvenal (<i>c.</i> 47-130), sum up for posterity the moral
experience of the Roman world from the accession
of Tiberius to the death of Domitian. The generous scorn
and pathos of the historian acting on extraordinary gifts of
imaginative insight and characterization, and the fierce indignation
of the satirist finding its vent in exaggerating realism,
doubtless to some extent warped their impressions; nevertheless
their works are the last voices expressive of the freedom and
manly virtue of the ancient world. In them alone among the
writers of the empire the spirit of the Roman republic seems to
revive. The <i>Letters</i> of C. Plinius Caecilius Secundus or Pliny
the Younger (61-<i>c.</i> 115), though they do not contradict the
representation of Tacitus and Juvenal regarded as an exposure
of the political degradation and moral corruption of prominent
individuals and classes, do much to modify the pervadingly
tragic and sombre character of their representation.</p>

<p>With the death of Juvenal, the most important part of whose
activity falls in the reign of Trajan, Latin literature as an
original and national expression of the experience, character,
and sentiment of the Roman state and empire, and as one of the
great literatures of the world, may be considered closed.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Later Writers.</i></p>

<p>What remains to describe is little but death and decay.
Poetry died first; the paucity of writings in verse is matched
by their insignificance. For two centuries after Juvenal there
are no names but those of Q. Serenus Sammonicus, with his
pharmacopoeia in verse (<i>c.</i> 225), and M. Aurelius Olympius
Nemesianus, who wrote a few feeble eclogues and (283) a dull
piece on the training of dogs for the chase. Towards the middle
of the 4th century we have Decimus Magnus Ausonius, a professor
of Bordeaux and afterwards consul (379), whose style is as
little like that of classical poetry as is his prosody. His <i>Mosella</i>,
a detailed description of the river Moselle, is the least unattractive
of his works. A little better is his contemporary, Rufius Festus
Avienus, who made some free translations of astronomical and
geographical poems in Greek. A generation later, in what
might be called the expiring effort of Latin poetry, appeared
two writers of much greater merit. The first is Claudius
Claudianus (<i>c.</i> 400), a native of Alexandria and the court poet
of the emperor Honorius and his minister Stilicho. Claudian
<span class="sidenote">Claudian.</span>
may be properly styled the last of the poets of Rome.
He breathes the old national spirit, and his mastery
of classical idiom and versification is for his age extraordinary.
Something of the same may be seen in Rutilius Namatianus,
a Gaul by birth, who wrote in 416 a description of his voyage
from the capital to his native land, which contains the most
glowing eulogy of Rome ever penned by an ancient hand.
Of the Christian &ldquo;poets&rdquo; only Aurelius Prudentius Clemens
(<i>c.</i> 348-410) need be mentioned. He was well read in the
ancient literature; but the task of embodying the Christian
spirit in the classical form was one far beyond his powers.</p>

<p>The vitality of the prose literature was not much greater though
its complete extinction was from the nature of the case impossible.
The most important writer in the age succeeding
Juvenal was the biographer C. Suetonius Tranquillus
<span class="sidenote">Suetonius.</span>
(<i>c.</i> 75-160), whose work is more valuable for its matter
than its manner. His style is simple and direct, but has hardly
any other merit. A little later the rise of M. Cornelius Fronto
(<i>c.</i> 100-175), a native of Cirta, marks the beginning of an African
influence. Fronto, a distinguished orator and intimate friend
of the emperor M. Aurelius, broke away from the traditional
Latin of the Silver and Golden ages, and took as his models the
pre-classical authors. The reaction was short-lived; but the
same affectation of antiquity is seen in the writings of Apuleius,
also an African, who lived a little later than Fronto and was
a man of much greater natural parts. In his <i>Metamorphoses</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Apuleius.</span>
which were based upon a Greek original, he takes the
wonderful story of the adventures of Lucius of Madaura,
and interweaves the famous legend of Cupid and Psyche. His
bizarre and mystical style has a strange fascination for the
reader; but there is nothing Roman or Italian about it. Two
epitomists of previous histories may be mentioned: Justinus
(of uncertain date) who abridged the history of Pompeius Trogus,
an Augustan writer; and P. Annius Florus, who wrote in the
reign of Hadrian a rhetorical sketch based upon Livy. The
<i>Historia Augusta</i>, which includes the lives of the emperors
from Hadrian to Numerianus (117-284), is the work of six
writers, four of whom wrote under Diocletian and two under
Constantine. It is a collection of personal memoirs of little
historical importance, and marked by puerility and poverty
of style. Ammianus Marcellinus (<i>c.</i> 330-400) had a higher
conception of the historian&rsquo;s function. His narrative of the
years 353-378 (all that now remains) is honest and straightforward,
but his diction is awkward and obscure. The last pagan
prose writer who need be mentioned is Q. Aurelius Symmachus
(<i>c.</i> 350-410), the author of some speeches and a collection of
letters. All the art of his ornate and courtly periods cannot
disguise the fact that there was nothing now for paganism to say.</p>

<p>It is in Christian writers alone that we find the vigour of life.
The earliest work of Christian apologetics is the <i>Octavius</i> or
Minucius Felix, a contemporary of Fronto. It is
written in pure Latin and is strongly tinged by classical
<span class="sidenote">Christian writers.</span>
influences. Quite different is the work of &ldquo;the
fierce Tertullian,&rdquo; Q. Septimius Florens Tertullianus (<i>c</i>. 150-230),
a native of Carthage, the most vigorous of the Latin champions
of the new faith. His style shows the African revolt of which we
have already spoken, and in its medley of archaisms, Graecisms
and Hebraisms reveals the strength of the disintegrating forces
at work upon the Latin language. A more commanding figure
is that of Aurelius Augustinus or St Augustine (354-430), bishop
of Hippo, who for comprehensiveness and dialectical power
stands out in the same way as Hieronymus or St Jerome (<i>c</i>. 331
or 340-420), a native of Stridon in Dalmatia, does for many-sided
learning and scholarship.</p>

<p>The decline of literature proper was attended by an increased
output of grammatical and critical studies. From the time of
L. Aelius Stilo Praeconinus, who was the teacher of
Varro and Cicero, much interest had been taken in
<span class="sidenote">Grammarians.</span>
literary and linguistic problems at Rome. Varro
under the republic, and M. Verrius Flaccus in the Augustan
age, had busied themselves with lexicography and etymology.
The grammarian M. Valerius Probus (<i>c</i>. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 60) was the first
critical editor of Latin texts. In the next century we have
Velius Longus&rsquo;s treatise <i>De Orthographia</i>, and then a much
more important work, the <i>Noctes Atticae</i> of Aulus Gellius, and
(<i>c</i>. 200) a treatise in verse by Terentianus, an African, upon
Latin pronunciation, prosody and metre. Somewhat later
are the commentators on Terence and Horace, Helenius Acro
and Pomponius Porphyrio. The tradition was continued in
the 4th century by Nonius Marcellus and C. Marius Victorinus,
both Africans; Aelius Donatus, the grammarian and commentator
on Terence and Virgil, Flavius Sosipater Charisius and
Diomedes, and Servius, the author of a valuable commentary
on Virgil. Ambrosius Macrobius Theodosius (<i>c</i>. 400) wrote a
treatise on Cicero&rsquo;s <i>Somnium Scipionis</i> and seven books of
miscellanies (<i>Saturnalia</i>); and Martianus Capella (<i>c</i>. 430), a
native of Africa, published a compendium of the seven liberal
arts, written in a mixture of prose and verse, with some literary
pretensions. The last grammarian who need be named is the
most widely known of all, the celebrated Priscianus, who published
his text-book at Constantinople probably in the middle
of the 5th century.</p>

<p>In jurisprudence, which may be regarded as one of the outlying
regions of literature, Roman genius had had some of its greatest
triumphs, and, if we take account of the &ldquo;codes,&rdquo; was active
to the end. The most distinguished of the early jurists (whose
<span class="sidenote">Jurists.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span>
works are lost) were Q. Mucius Scaevola, who died in 82 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
and following him Ser. Sulpicius Rufus, who died in 43 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
In the Augustan age M. Antistius Labeo and C. Ateius
Capito headed two opposing schools in jurisprudence,
Labeo being an advocate of method and reform, and
Capito being a conservative and empiricist. The strife, which
reflects the controversy between the &ldquo;analogists&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;anomalists&rdquo; in philology, continued long after their death.
Salvius Julianus was entrusted by Hadrian with the task of
reducing into shape the immense mass of law which had grown
up in the edicts of successive praetors&mdash;thus taking the first
step towards a code. Sex. Pomponius, a contemporary, wrote
an important legal manual of which fragments are preserved.
The most celebrated handbook, however, is the <i>Institutiones</i>
of Gaius, who lived under Antonius Pius&mdash;a model of what such
treatises should be. The most eminent of all the Roman jurists
was Aemilius Papinianus, the intimate friend of Septimius
Severus; of his works only fragments remain. Other considerable
writers were the prolific Domitius Ulpianus (<i>c.</i> 215) and
Julius Paulus, his contemporary. The last juristical writer of
note was Herennius Modestinus (<i>c.</i> 240). But though the line
of great lawyers had ceased, the effects of their work remained
and are clearly visible long after in the &ldquo;codes&rdquo;&mdash;the code of
Theodosius (438) and the still more famous code of Justinian
(529 and 533), with which is associated the name of Tribonianus.</p>

and eponymous hero of the Latin race. In Hesiod (<i>Theogony</i>,
1013) he is the son of Odysseus and Circe, and ruler of the Tyrsenians;
in Virgil, the son of Faunus and the nymph Marica,
a national genealogy being substituted for the Hesiodic, which
probably originated from a Greek source. Latinus was a
shadowy personality, invented to explain the origin of Rome
and its relations with Latium, and only obtained importance
in later times through his legendary connexion with Aeneas
and the foundation of Rome. According to Virgil (<i>Aeneid</i>,

breadth or width, hence, figuratively, freedom from restriction,
but more generally used in the geographical and astronomical
sense here treated. The latitude of a point on the earth&rsquo;s surface
is its angular distance from the equator, measured on the curved
surface of the earth. The direct measure of this distance being
impracticable, it has to be determined by astronomical observations.
As thus determined it is the angle between the direction
of the plumb-line at the place and the plane of the equator.
This is identical with the angle between the horizontal planes
at the place and at the equator, and also with the elevation of
the celestial pole above the horizon (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Astronomy</a></span>). Latitude
thus determined by the plumb-line is termed <i>astronomical</i>.
The <i>geocentric latitude</i> of a place is the angle which the line from
the earth&rsquo;s centre to the place makes with the plane of the
equator. <i>Geographical latitude</i>, which is used in mapping, is
based on the supposition that the earth is an elliptic spheroid
of known compression, and is the angle which the normal to this
spheroid makes with the equator. It differs from the astronomical
latitude only in being corrected for local deviation of
the plumb-line.</p>

<p>The latitude of a celestial object is the angle which the line
drawn from some fixed point of reference to the object makes
with the plane of the ecliptic.</p>

<p><i>Variability of Terrestrial Latitudes</i>.&mdash;The latitude of a point
on the earth&rsquo;s surface, as above defined, is measured from the
equator. The latter is defined by the condition that its plane
makes a right angle with the earth&rsquo;s axis of rotation. It follows
that if the points in which this axis intersects the earth&rsquo;s surface,
<i>i.e</i>. the poles of the earth, change their positions on the earth&rsquo;s
surface, the position of the equator will also change, and therefore
the latitudes of places will change also. About the end of
the 19th century research showed that there actually was a very
minute but measurable periodic change of this kind. The north
and south poles, instead of being fixed points on the earth&rsquo;s
surface, wander round within a circle about 50 ft. in diameter.
The result is a variability of terrestrial latitudes generally.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>To show the cause of this motion, let BQ represent a section of an
oblate spheroid through its shortest axis, PP. We may consider this
spheroid to be that of the earth, the ellipticity being greatly exaggerated.
If set in rotation around its axis of figure PP, it will continue
to rotate around that axis for an indefinite time. But if,
instead of rotating around PP, it rotates around some other axis, RR,
making a small angle,
POR, with the axis of
figure PP; then it has
been known since the time
of Euler that the axis of
rotation RR, if referred
to the spheroid regarded
as fixed, will gradually
rotate round the axis of
figure PP in a period defined
in the following
way:&mdash;If we put C = the
moment of momentum of
the spheroid around the
axis of figure, and A =
the corresponding moment
around an axis passing
through the equator EQ,
then, calling one day the
period of rotation of the
spheroid, the axis RR will
make a revolution around PP in a number of days represented by
the fraction C/(C &minus; A). In the case of the earth, this ratio is
1/0.0032813 or 305. It follows that the period in question is 305
days.</p>
</div>

<p>Up to 1890 the most careful observations and researches
failed to establish the periodicity of such a rotation, though
there was strong evidence of a variation of latitude. Then
S. C. Chandler, from an elaborate discussion of a great number
of observations, showed that there was really a variation of the
latitude of the points of observation; but, instead of the period
being 305 days, it was about 428 days. At first sight this period
seemed to be inconsistent with dynamical theory. But a defect
was soon found in the latter, the correction of which reconciled
the divergence. In deriving a period of 305 days the earth is
regarded as an absolutely rigid body, and no account is taken
either of its elasticity or of the mobility of the ocean. A study
of the figure will show that the centrifugal force round the axis
RR will act on the equatorial protuberance of the rotating
earth so as to make it tend in the direction of the arrows. A
slight deformation of the earth will thus result; and the axis of
figure of the distorted spheroid will no longer be PP, but a line
P&prime;P&prime; between PP and RR. As the latter moves round, P&prime;P&prime; will
continually follow it through the incessant change of figure produced
by the change in the direction of the centrifugal force.
Now the rate of motion of RR is determined by the actual figure
at the moment. It is therefore less than the motion in an
absolutely rigid spheroid in the proportion RP&prime; : RP. It is found
that, even though the earth were no more elastic than steel, its
yielding combined with the mobility of the ocean would make this
ratio about 2 : 3, resulting in an increase of the period by one-half,
making it about 457 days. Thus this small flexibility is even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>
greater than that necessary to the reconciliation of observation
with theory, and the earth is shown to be more rigid than steel&mdash;a
conclusion long since announced by Kelvin for other reasons.</p>

<p>Chandler afterwards made an important addition to the subject
by showing that the motion was represented by the superposition
of two harmonic terms, the first having a period of about 430
days, the other of one year. The result of this superposition is
a seven-year period, which makes 6 periods of the 428-day term
(428<span class="sp">d</span> √ó 6 = 2568<span class="sp">d</span> = 7 years, nearly), and 7 periods of the annual
term. Near one phase of this combined period the two component
motions nearly annul each other, so that the variation
is then small, while at the opposite phase, 3 to 4 years later, the
two motions are in the same direction and the range of variation
is at its maximum. The coefficient of the 428-day term seems
to be between 0.12&Prime; and 0.16&Prime;; that of the annual term between
0.06&Prime; and 0.11&Prime;. Recent observations give smaller values of both
than those made between 1890 and 1900, and there is no reason
to suppose either to be constant.</p>

<p>The present state of the theory may be summed up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The fourteen-month term is an immediate result of the
fact that the axes of rotation and figure of the earth do not
strictly coincide, but make with each other a small angle of
which the mean value is about 0.15&Prime;. If the earth remained
invariable, without any motion of matter on its surface, the
result of this non-coincidence would be the revolution of the one
pole round the other in a circle of radius 0.15&Prime;, or about 15 ft.,
in a period of about 429 days. This revolution is called the
<i>Eulerian motion</i>, after the mathematician who discovered it.
But owing to meteorological causes the motion in question is
subject to annual changes. These changes arise from two
causes&mdash;the one statical, the other dynamical.</p>

<p>2. The statical causes are deposits of snow or ice slowly
changing the position of the pole of figure of the earth. For
example, a deposit of snow in Siberia would bring the equator of
figure of the earth a little nearer to Siberia and throw the pole
a little way from it, while a deposit on the American continent
would have the opposite effect. Owing to the approximate
symmetry of the American and Asiatic continents it does not
seem likely that the inequality of snowfall would produce an
appreciable effect.</p>

<p>3. The dynamical causes are atmospheric and oceanic currents.
Were these currents invariable their only effect would be that the
Eulerian motion would not take place exactly round the mean
pole of figure, but round a point slightly separated from it.
But, as a matter of fact, they are subject to an annual variation.
Hence the motion of the pole of rotation is also subject to a
similar variation. The annual term in the latitude is thus
accounted for.</p>

<p>Besides Chandler, Albrecht of Berlin has investigated the
motion of the pole P. The methods of the two astronomers are
in some points different. Chandler has constructed empirical
formulae representing the motion, with the results already given,
while Albrecht has determined the motion of the pole from
observation simply, without trying to represent it either by a
formula or by theory. It is noteworthy that the difference
between Albrecht&rsquo;s numerical results and Chandler&rsquo;s formulae is
generally less than 0.05&Prime;.</p>

<p>When the fluctuation in the position of the pole was fully
confirmed, its importance in astronomy and geodesy led the
International Geodetic Association to establish a series of
stations round the globe, as nearly as possible on the same
parallel of latitude, for the purpose of observing the fluctuation
with a greater degree of precision than could be attained by the
miscellaneous observations before available. The same stars
were to be observed from month to month at each station with
zenith-telescopes of similar approved construction. This secures
a double observation of each component of the polar motion,
from which most of the systematic errors are eliminated. The
principal stations are: Carloforte, Italy; Mizusawa, Japan;
Gaithersburg, Maryland; and Ukiah, California, all nearly
on the same parallel of latitude, 39¬∞ 8&prime;.</p>

<p>The fluctuations derived from this international work during
the last seven years deviate but slightly from Chandler&rsquo;s formulae
though they show a markedly smaller value of the annual term.
In consequence, the change in the amplitude of the fluctuation
through the seven-year period is not so well marked as before 1900.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Chandler&rsquo;s investigations are found in a series of papers published
in the <i>Astronomical Journal</i>, vols. xi. to xv. and xviii. Newcomb&rsquo;s
explanation of the lengthening of the Eulerian period is found in the
<i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i> for March 1892.
Later volumes of the <i>Astronomical Journal</i> contain discussions of the
causes which may produce the annual fluctuation. An elaborate
mathematical discussion of the theory is by Vito Volterra: &ldquo;Sulla
teoria dei movimenti del Polo terrestre&rdquo; in the <i>Astronomische

<p><span class="bold">LATIUM<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span>,<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> in ancient geography, the name given to the
portion of central Italy which was bounded on the N.W. by
Etruria, on the S.W. by the Tyrrhenian Sea, on the S.E. by
Campania, on the E. by Samnium and on the N.E. by the
mountainous district inhabited by the Sabini, Aequi and Marsi.
The name was, however, applied very differently at different
times. Latium originally means the land of the Latini, and in
this sense, which alone is in use historically, it was a tract of
limited extent; but after the overthrow of the Latin confederacy,
when the neighbouring tribes of the Rutuli, Hernici, Volsci and
Aurunci, as well as the Latini properly so called, were reduced
to the condition of subjects and citizens of Rome, the name of
Latium was extended to comprise them all. It thus denoted the
whole country from the Tiber to the mouth of the Savo, and just
included the Mons Massicus, though the boundary was not very
precisely fixed (see below). The change thus introduced, though
already manifest in the composition of the Latin league (see
below) was not formally established till the reign of Augustus,
who formed of this larger Latium and Campania taken together
the first region of Italy; but it is already recognized by Strabo
(v. 3. 2. p. 228), as well as by Pliny, who terms the additional
territory thus incorporated <i>Latium Adjectum</i>, while he designates
the original Latium, extending from the Tiber to Circeii, as
<i>Latium Antiquum</i>.</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Latium Antiquum</span> consisted principally of an extensive
plain, now known as the Campagna di Roma, bounded towards
the interior by the Apennines, which rise very abruptly from the
plains to a height of between 4000 and 5000 ft. Several of the
Latin cities, including Tibur and Praeneste, were situated on the
terrace-like underfalls of these mountains,<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> while Cora, Norba
and Setia were placed in like manner on the slopes of the Volscian
mountains (Monti Lepini), a rugged and lofty limestone range,
which runs parallel to the main mass of the Apennines, being
separated from them, however, by the valley of the Trerus
(Sacco), and forms a continuous barrier from there to Terracina.
No volcanic eruptions are known to have taken place in these
mountains within the historic period, though Livy sometimes
speaks of it &ldquo;raining stones in the Alban hills&rdquo; (i. 31, xxxv. 9&mdash;on
the latter occasion it even did so on the Aventine). It is
asserted, too, that some of the earliest tombs of the necropolis
of Alba Longa (<i>q.v.</i>) were found beneath a stratum of peperino.
Earthquakes (not of a violent character within recent centuries,
though the ruin of the Colosseum is probably to be ascribed to
this cause) are not unknown even at the present day in Rome
and in the Alban Hills, and a seismograph has been established
at Rocca di Papa. The surface is by no means a uniform plain,
but is a broad undulating tract, furrowed throughout by numerous
depressions, with precipitous banks, serving as water-courses,
though rarely traversed by any considerable stream. As the
general level of the plain rises gradually, though almost imperceptibly,
to the foot of the Apennines, these channels by
degrees assume the character of ravines of a formidable description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Four main periods may be distinguished in the geological history
of Rome and the surrounding district. The hills on the right bank
of the Tiber culminating in Monte Mario (455 ft.) belong
to the first of these, being of the Pliocene formation; they
<span class="sidenote">Geology.</span>
consist of a lower bluish-grey clay and an upper group of yellow sands
and gravels. This clay since Roman times has supplied the material
for brick-making, and the valleys which now separate the different
summits (Janiculum, Vatican, Monte Mario) are in considerable
measure artificial. On the left bank this clay has been reached at a
lower level, at the foot of the Pincian Hill, while in the Campagna it
has been found to extend below the later volcanic formations. The
latter may be divided into two groups, corresponding to the second
and third periods. In the second period volcanic activity occurred
at the bottom of the Pliocene sea, and the tufa, which extends over
the whole Campagna to a thickness of 300 ft. or more, was formed.
At the same time, hot springs, containing abundant carbonate of
lime in solution, produced deposits of travertine at various points.
In the third, after the Campagna, by a great general uplift, had
become a land surface, volcanic energy found an outlet in comparatively
few large craters, which emitted streams of hard lava as
well as fragmentary materials, the latter forming sperone (<i>lapis
Gabinus</i>) and peperino (<i>lapis Albanus</i>), while upon one of the former,
which runs from the Alban Hills to within 2 m. of Rome, the Via
Appia was carried. The two main areas near Rome are formed by
the group of craters on the north (Bracciano, Bolsena, &amp;c.) and the
Alban Hills on the south, the latter consisting of one great crater
with a base about 12 m. in diameter, in the centre of which a smaller
crater was later on built up (the basin is now known as the Campo di
Annibale) with several lateral vents (the Lake of Albano, the Lake
of Nemi, &amp;c.). The Alban Mount (Monte Cavo) is almost the
highest point on the rim of the inner crater, while Mount Algidus and
Tusculum are on the outer ring wall of the larger (earlier) crater.</p>

<p>The fourth period is that in which the various suba√´rial agencies of
abrasion, and especially the streams which drain the mountain chain
of the Apennines, have produced the present features of the Campagna,
a plain furrowed by gullies and ravines. The communities
which inhabited the detached hills and projecting ridges which later
on formed the city of Rome were in a specially favourable position.
These hills (especially the Palatine, the site of the original settlement)
with their naturally steep sides, partly surrounded at the base
by marshes and situated not far from the confluence of the Anio with
the Tiber, possessed natural advantages not shared by the other
primitive settlements of the district; and their proximity to one
another rendered it easy to bring them into a larger whole. The
volcanic materials available in Rome and its neighbourhood were
especially useful in building. The tufa, sperone and peperino were
easy to quarry, and could be employed by those who possessed comparatively
elementary tools, while travertine, which came into use
later, was an excellent building stone, and the lava (<i>selce</i>) served
for paving stones and as material for concrete. The strength of the
renowned Roman concrete is largely due to the use of pozzolana (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Puteoli</a></span>), which also is found in plenty in the Campagna.</p>

<p>Between the volcanic tract of the Campagna and the sea there is a
broad strip of sandy plain, evidently formed merely by the accumulation
of sand from the sea, and constituting a barren tract, still
covered almost entirely with wood as it was in ancient times, except
for the almost uninterrupted line of villas along the ancient coast-line,
which is now marked by a line of sand-hills, some ¬Ω m. or more
inland (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lavinium, Tiber</a></span>). This long belt of sandy shore extends
without a break for a distance of above 30 m. from the mouth of the
Tiber to the promontory of Antium (Porto d&rsquo;Anzio); a low rocky
headland, projecting out into the sea, and forming the only considerable
angle in this line of coast. Thence again a low sandy shore
of similar character, but with extensive shore lagoons which served in
Roman times and serve still for fish-breeding, extends for about 24 m.
to the foot of the Monte Circeo (<i>Circeius Mons</i>, <i>q.v.</i>). The region of
the Pomptine Marshes (<i>q.v.</i>) occupies almost the whole tract between
the sandy belt on the seashore and the Volscian mountains, extending
from the southern foot of the Alban Hills below Velletri to the sea
near Terracina.</p>

<p>The district sloping down from Velletri to the dead level of the
Pontine (Pomptine) Marshes has not, like the western and northern
slopes of the Alban Hills, drainage towards the Tiber.
The subsoil too is differently formed: the surface consists
<span class="sidenote">Drainage.</span>
of very absorbent materials, then comes a stratum of less permeable
tufa or peperino (sometimes clay is present), and below that again
more permeable materials. In ancient, and probably pre-Roman,
times this district was drained by an elaborate system of <i>cuniculi</i>,
small drainage tunnels, about 5 ft. high and 2 ft. wide, which ran, not
at the bottom of the valleys, where there were sometimes streams
already, and where, in any case, erosion would have broken through
their roofs, but along their slopes, through the less permeable tufa,
their object being to drain the hills on each side of the valleys.
They had probably much to do with the relative healthiness of this
district in early times. Some of them have been observed to be
earlier in date than the Via Appia (312 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). They were studied in
detail by R. de la Blanch√®re. When they fell into desuetude,
malaria gained the upper hand, the lack of drainage providing
breeding-places for the malarial mosquito. Remains of similar
drainage channels exist in many parts of the Campagna Romana
and of southern Etruria at points where the natural drainage was not
sufficient, and especially in cultivated or inhabited hills (though it
was not necessary here, as in the neighbourhood of Velletri, to create
a drainage system, as streams and rivers were already present as
natural collectors) and streams very frequently pass through them
at the present day. The drainage channels which were dug for the
various crater lakes in the neighbourhood of Rome are also interesting
in this regard. That of the Alban Lake is the most famous;
but all the other crater lakes are similarly provided. As the drainage
by <i>cuniculi</i> removed the moisture in the subsoil, so the drainage of the
lakes by <i>emissaria</i>, outlet channels at a low level, prevented the
permeable strata below the tufa from becoming impregnated with
moisture which they would otherwise have derived from the lakes of
the Alban Hills. The slopes below Velletri, on the other hand,
derive much of their moisture from the space between the inner and
outer ring of the Alban volcano, which it was impossible to drain:
and this in turn receives much moisture from the basin of the extinct
inner crater.<a name="fa3c" id="fa3c" href="#ft3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>Numerous isolated palaeolithic objects of the Mousterian type
have been found in the neighbourhood of Rome in the quaternary
gravels of the Tiber and Anio; but no certain traces
of the neolithic period have come to light, as the many
<span class="sidenote">Pre-historic remains.</span>
flint implements found sporadically round Rome probably
belong to the period which succeeded neolithic
(called by Italian archaeologists the eneolithic period) inasmuch
as both stone and metal (not, however, bronze, but copper) were
in use.<a name="fa4c" id="fa4c" href="#ft4c"><span class="sp">4</span></a> At Sgurgola, in the valley of the Sacco, a skeleton was
found in a rock-cut tomb of this period which still bears traces
of painting with cinnabar. A similar rock-cut tomb was found
at Mandela, in the Anio valley. Both are outside the limits of
the Campagna in the narrower sense; but similar tombs were
found (though less accurately observed) in travertine quarries
between Rome and Tivoli. Objects of the Bronze age too have only
been found sporadically. The earliest cemeteries and hut foundations
of the Alban Hills belong to the Iron age, and cemeteries and objects
of a similar character have been found in Rome itself and in southern
Etruria, especially the characteristic hut-urns. The objects found
in these cemeteries show close affinity with those found in the
terremare of Emilia, these last being of earlier date, and hence
Pigorini and Helbig consider that the Latini were close descendants
of the inhabitants of the terremare. On the other hand, the ossuaries
of the Villanova type, while they occur as far south as Veii and Caere,
have never so far been found on the left bank of the Tiber, in Latium
proper (see L. Pigorini in <i>Rendiconti dei Lincei</i>, ser. v. vol. xvi., 1907,
p. 676, and xviii., 1909). We thus have at the beginning of the Iron
age two distinct currents of civilization in central Italy, the Latin
and that of Villanova. As to the dates to which these are to be
attributed, there is not as yet complete accord, <i>e.g</i>. some archaeologists
assign to the 11th, others (and with far better reasons) to
the 8th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, the earliest tombs of the Alban necropolis and
the coeval tombs of the necropolis recently discovered in the Forum
at Rome. In this last necropolis cremation seems slightly to precede
inhumation in date.</p>

<p>For the prehistoric period see <i>Bullettino di paleontologia Italiana,
passim</i>, B. Modestov, <i>Introduction √† l&rsquo;histoire romaine</i> (Paris, 1907),

<p>It is uncertain to what extent reliance can be placed upon the
traditional accounts of the gradual spread of the supremacy
of Rome in Latium, and the question cannot be
discussed here.<a name="fa5c" id="fa5c" href="#ft5c"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The list of the thirty communities belonging
<span class="sidenote">Latin League.</span>
to the Latin league, given by Dionysius of Halicarnassus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>
(v. 61), is, however, of great importance. It is considered by Th.
Mommsen (<i>Roman History</i>, i. 448) that it dates from about
the year 370 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, to which period belong the closing of the
confederacy, no fresh communities being afterwards admitted
to it, and the consequent fixing of the boundaries of Latium.
The list is as follows: Ardeates, Aricini, Bovillani,<a name="fa6c" id="fa6c" href="#ft6c"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Bubentani,
Cabani, Carventani, Circeiates, Coriolani, Corbintes, Corni
(probably Corani), Fortinei (?), Gabini, Laurentini, Lavinates,
Labicani, Lanuvini, Nomentani, Norbani, Praenestini, Pedani,
Querquetulani, Satricani, Scaptini, Setini, Tellenii, Tiburtini,
Tolerini, Tusculani, Veliterni.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>These communities may be briefly described according to their
geographical arrangement. Laurentum and Lavinium, names so
conspicuous in the legendary history of Aeneas, were situated in the
sandy strip near the sea-coast&mdash;the former only 8 m. S.E. of Ostia,
which was from the first merely the port of Rome, and never figured
as an independent city. Farther S.E. again lay Ardea, the ancient
capital of the Rutuli, and some distance beyond that Antium,
situated on the sea-coast, which does not occur in the list of Dionysius,
and is, in the early annals of Rome, called a Volscian town&mdash;even
their chief city. On the southern underfalls of the Alban mountains,
commanding the plain at the foot, stood Lanuvium and Velitrae;
Aricia rose on a neighbouring hill, and Corioli was probably situated
on the lower slopes. The village of the Cabani (probably identical
with the Cabenses) is possibly to be sought on the site of the modern
Rocca di Papa, N. of Monte Cavo. The more important city of
Tusculum occupied one of the northern summits of the same group;
while opposite to it, in a commanding situation on a lofty offshoot of
the Apennines, rose Praeneste, now Palestrina. Bola and Pedum
were probably in the same neighbourhood, Labici on an outlying
summit (Monte Compatri) of the Alban Hills below Tusculum, and
Corbio (probably at Rocca Priora) on a rocky summit east of the
same city. Tibur (Tivoli) occupied a height commanding the outlet
of the river Anio. Corniculum, farther west, stood on the summit of
one of three conical hills that rise abruptly out of the plain at the
distance of a few miles from Monte Gennaro, the nearest of the
Apennines, and which were thence known as the Montes Corniculani.
Nomentum was a few miles farther north, between the Apennines and
the Tiber, and close to the Sabine frontier. The boundary between
the two nations was indeed in this part very fluctuating. Nearly in
the centre of the plain of the Campagna stood Gabii; Bovillae was
also in the plain, but close to the Appian Way, where it begins to
ascend the Alban Hills. Several other cities&mdash;Tellenae, Scaptia and
Querquetulum&mdash;mentioned in the list of Dionysius were probably
situated in the Campagna, but the site cannot be determined.
Satricum, on the other hand, was certainly south of the Alban Hills,
between Velitrae and Antium; while Cora, Norba and Setia (all of
which retain their ancient names with little modification) crowned
the rocky heights which form advanced posts from the Volscian
mountains towards the Pontine Marshes. Carventum possibly
occupied the site of Rocca Massima N. of Cori, and Tolerium was very
likely at Valmontone in the valley of the Sacco (anc. Trerus or Tolerus).
The cities of the Bubentani and Fortinei are quite unknown.</p>
</div>

<p>A considerable number of the Latin cities had before 370 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
either been utterly destroyed or reduced to subjection by Rome,
and had thus lost their independent existence. Such were
Antemnae and Caenina, both of them situated within a few
miles of Rome to the N., the conquest of which was ascribed to
Romulus; Fidenae, about 5 m. N. of the city, and close to the
Tiber; and Crustumerium, in the hilly tract farther north
towards the Sabine frontier. Suessa Pometia also, on the borders
of the Pontine Marshes, to which it was said to have given name,
was a city of importance, the destruction of which was ascribed
to Tarquinius Superbus. In any case it had disappeared before
370 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, as it does not occur in the list of the Latin league attributable
to that date. It is probably to be sought between Velletri
and Cisterna. But by far the most important of these extinct
cities was Alba, on the lake to which it gave its name, which
was, according to universally received tradition, the parent of
Rome, as well as of numerous other cities within the limits of
Latium, including Gabii, Fidenae, Collatia, Nomentum and other
well-known towns. Whether or not this tradition deserves to
rank as historical, it appears certain that at a still earlier period
there existed a confederacy of thirty towns, of which Alba was
the supreme head. A list of those who were wont to participate
in the sacrifices on the Alban Mount is given us by Pliny (<i>N.H.</i>
iii. 5. 69) under the name of <i>populi albenses</i>, which includes only
six or at most eight of those found in the list of Dionysius;<a name="fa7c" id="fa7c" href="#ft7c"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
and these for the most part among the more obscure and least
known of the names given by him. Many of the rest are unknown;
while the more powerful cities of Aricia, Lanuvium
and Tusculum, though situated immediately on the Alban Hills,
are not included, and appear to have maintained a wholly
independent position. This earlier league was doubtless broken
up by the fall of Alba; it was probably the increasing power
of the Volsci and Aequi that led to the formation of the later
league, including all the more powerful cities of Latium, as well
as to the alliance concluded by them with the Romans in the
consulship of Spurius Cassius (493 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). Other cities of the Latin
league had already (according to the traditional dates) received
Latin colonies&mdash;Velitrae (494 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Norba (492), Ardea (442),
Labici (418), Circei (393), Satricum (385), Setia (382).</p>

<p>The cities of the Latin league continued to hold general
meetings or assemblies from time to time at the grove of the
Aqua Ferentina, a sanctuary at the foot of the Alban Hills,
perhaps in a valley below Marino, while they had also a common
place of worship on the summit of the Alban Mount (Monte
Cavo), where stood the celebrated temple of Jupiter Latiaris.
The participation in the annual sacrifices at this sanctuary was
regarded as typical of a Latin city (hence the name &ldquo;prisci
Latini&rdquo; given to the participating peoples); and they continued
to be celebrated long after the Latins had lost their independence
and been incorporated in the Roman state.<a name="fa8c" id="fa8c" href="#ft8c"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>We are on firmer ground in dealing with the spread of the
supremacy of Rome in Latium when we take account of the
foundation of new colonies and of the formation of
new tribes, processes which as a rule go together. The
<span class="sidenote">Roman supremacy.</span>
information that we have as to the districts in which
the sixteen earliest clans (<i>tribus rusticae</i>)<a name="fa9c" id="fa9c" href="#ft9c"><span class="sp">9</span></a> were settled shows us
that, except along the Tiber, Rome&rsquo;s dominion extended hardly
more than 5 m. beyond the city gates (Mommsen, <i>History of
Rome</i>, i. 58). Thus, towards the N. and E. we find the towns of
Antemnae, Fidenae, Caenina and Gabii;<a name="fa10c" id="fa10c" href="#ft10c"><span class="sp">10</span></a> on the S.E., towards
Alba, the boundary of Roman territory was at the Fossae
Cluiliae, 5 m. from Rome, where Coriolanus encamped (Livy ii.
39), and, on the S., towards Laurentum at the 6th mile, where
sacrifice to Terminus was made (Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>, ii. 681): the
Ambarvalia too were celebrated even in Strabo&rsquo;s day (v. 3. 3. p.
230) at a place called <span class="grk" title="Ph√™stoi">&#934;&#8134;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span> between the 5th and 6th mile.
The identification (cf. H√ºlsen in Pauly-Wissowa, <i>Realencyclop√§die</i>,
vi. 2223) of this locality with the grove of the Arval
brothers at the 5th mile of the Via Portuensis, to the W. of
Rome, and of the Ambarvalia with the festival celebrated by
this brotherhood in May of each year, is now generally accepted.
But Roman sway must either from the first, or very soon, have
extended to Ostia, the port of Rome at the mouth of the Tiber:
and it was as the emporium of Latium that Rome acquired her
first importance.<a name="fa11c" id="fa11c" href="#ft11c"><span class="sp">11</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>271</span></p>

<p>The boundary of the <i>Ager Romanus antiquus</i> towards the
north-west is similarly fixed by the festival of the Robigalia
at the 5th milestone of the Via Clodia. Within this
area fall the districts inhabited by the earliest tribes,
<span class="sidenote">The primitive tribes.</span>
so far as these are known to us. The <i>tribus Romilia</i>
was settled on the right bank of the Tiber near the
sanctuary of the Arvales, the <i>Galeria</i> perhaps a little farther
west on the lower course of the stream now known as Galera,
and the <i>Fabia</i> perhaps on the Cremera towards Veii. We know
that the <i>pagus Lemonius</i> was on the Via Latina, and that the
<i>tribus Pupinia</i> dwelt between Tusculum and the city, while
the territory of the <i>Papiria</i> possibly lay nearer Tusculum, as
it was to this tribe that the Roman citizens in Tusculum belonged
in later days. It is possible that the <i>Camilia</i> was situated in
the direction of Tibur, inasmuch as this town was afterwards
enrolled in this tribe. The <i>tribus Claudia</i>, probably the last
of the 16 older <i>tribus rusticae</i>, was according to tradition founded
in 504 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Its territory lay beyond the Anio, between Fidenae
and Ficulea (Liv. ii. 16; Dion. Hal. v. 40). The locality of the
<i>pagi</i> round which the other tribes were grouped is not known
to us.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>With the earliest extensions of the Roman territory coincided the
first beginnings of the Roman road system. The road to Ostia may
have existed from the first: but after the Latin communities
on the lower Anio had fallen under the dominion
<span class="sidenote">Road system.</span>
of Rome, we may well believe that the first portion of the
Via Salaria, leading to Antemnae, Fidenae (the fall of which is placed
by tradition in 428 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and Crustumerium, came into existence.
The formation (according to the traditional dating in 495 or 471 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)
of the <i>tribus Clustumina</i> (the only one of the earlier twenty-one tribes
which bears a local name) is both a consequence of an extension of
territory and of the establishment of the assembly of the plebs by
tribes, for which an inequality of the total number of divisions was
desirable (Mommsen, <i>History of Rome</i>, i. 360). The correlative of the
Via Salaria was the Via Campana, so called because it led past the
grove of the Arvales along the right bank of the Tiber to the Campus
Salinarum Romanarum,<a name="fa12c" id="fa12c" href="#ft12c"><span class="sp">12</span></a> the salt marshes, from which the Via
Salaria took its name, inasmuch as it was the route by which Sabine
traders came from the interior to fetch the salt. To this period
would also belong the Via Ficulensis, leading to Ficulea, and afterwards
prolonged to Nomentum, and the Via Collatina, which led
to Collatia. Gabii became Roman in fairly early times, though at
what period is uncertain, and with its subjugation must have originated
the Via Gabina, afterwards prolonged to Praeneste. The Via
Latina too must be of very early origin; and tradition places the
foundation of the Latin colony at Signia (to which it led) as early as
495 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Not long after the capture of Fidenae, the main outpost of
Veii, the chief city itself fell (396 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and a road (still traceable)
was probably made thither. There was also probably a road to
Caere in early times, inasmuch as we hear of the flight of the Vestals
thither in 389 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The origin of the rest of the roads is no doubt to
be connected with the gradual establishment of the Latin league.
We find that while the later (long distance) roads bear as a rule the
name of their constructor, all the short distance roads on the left
bank of the Tiber bear the names of towns which belonged to the
league&mdash;Nomentum, Tibur, Praeneste, Labici, Ardea, Laurentum&mdash;while
Ficulea and Collatia do not appear. The Via Pedana,
leading to Pedum, is known to us only from an inscription (<i>Bull. Soc.
Antiquaires de France</i>, 1905, p. 177) discovered in Tunisia in 1905, and
may be of much later origin; it was a branch of the Via Praenestina.</p>

<p>There must too have been a road, along the line of the later Via
Appia, to Bovillae, Aricia, Lanuvium and Velitrae, going thence to
Cora, Norba and Setia along the foot of the Volscian Mountains;
while nameless roads, which can still be traced, led direct from Rome
to Satricum and to Lavinium.</p>
</div>

<p>We can trace the advance of the Roman supremacy with
greater ease after 387 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, inasmuch as from this year (adopting
the traditional dating for what it is worth) until 299 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> every
accession of territory is marked by the foundation of a group
of new tribes; the limit of 35 in all was reached in the latter
year. In 387, after the departure of the Gauls, southern Etruria
was conquered, and four new tribes were formed: <i>Arnensis</i>
(probably derived from Aro, mod. Arrone&mdash;though the ancient
name does not occur in literature&mdash;the stream which forms
the outlet to the lake of Bracciano, anc. <i>Lacus Sabatinus</i>),<a name="fa13c" id="fa13c" href="#ft13c"><span class="sp">13</span></a>
<i>Sabatina</i> (called after this lake), <i>Stellatina</i> (named from the
Campus Stellatinus, near Capena; cf. Festus p. 343 M√ºll.) and
<i>Tromentina</i> (which, Festus tells us, was so called from the
Campus Tromentus, the situation of which we do not know).
Four years later were founded the Latin colonies of Sutrium and
Nepet. In 358 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Roman preponderance in the Pomptine
territory was shown by the formation of the <i>tribus Pomptina</i>
and <i>Publilia</i>, while in 338 and 329 respectively Antium and
Tarracina became colonies of Roman citizens, the former having
been founded as a Latin colony in 494 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p>After the dissolution of the Latin league which followed
upon the defeat of the united forces of the Samnites and of those
Latin and Volscian cities which had revolted against Rome,
two new tribes, <i>Maecia and Scaptia</i>,<a name="fa14c" id="fa14c" href="#ft14c"><span class="sp">14</span></a> were created in 332 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
in connexion with the distribution of the newly acquired lands
(Mommsen, <i>History</i>, i. 462). A further advance in the same
direction ending in the capture of Privernum in 329 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> is
marked by the establishment in 318 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> of the <i>tribus Oufentina</i>
(from the river Ufens which runs below Setia, mod. <i>Sezze</i>, and
Privernum, mod. <i>Piperno</i>, and the <i>tribus Falerna</i> (in the Ager
Falernus), while the foundation of the colonies of Cales (334)
and Fregellae (328) secured the newly won south Volscian and
Campanian territories and led no doubt to a prolongation of
the Via Latina. The moment had now come for the pushing
forward of another line of communication, which had no doubt
reached Tarracina in 329 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> but was now definitely constructed
(<i>munita</i>) as a permanent military highway as far as Capua in
312 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by Appius Claudius, after whom it was named. To
him no doubt is due the direct line of road through the Pontine
Marshes from Velitrae to Terracina. Its construction may
fairly be taken to mark the period at which the roads of which
we have spoken, hitherto probably mere tracks, began to be
transformed into real highways. In the same year (312) the
colony of Interamna Lirenas was founded, while Luceria, Suessa
(Aurunca) and Saticula had been established a year or two
previously. Sora followed nine years later. In 299 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> further
successes led to the establishment of two new tribes&mdash;the <i>Teretina</i>
in the upper valley of the Trerus (Sacco) and the <i>Aniensis</i>,
in the upper valley of the Anio&mdash;while to about the same time
we must attribute the construction of two new military roads,
both secured by fortresses. The southern road, the Via Valeria
led to Carsioli and Alba Fucens (founded as Latin colonies
respectively in 298 and 303 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and the northern (afterwards
the Via Flaminia<a name="fa15c" id="fa15c" href="#ft15c"><span class="sp">15</span></a>) to Narnia (founded as a Latin colony in
299 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). There is little doubt that the formation of the <i>tribus
Quirina</i> (deriving its name possibly from the town of Cures)
and the <i>tribus Velina</i> (from the river Velinus, which forms
the well-known waterfalls near Terni) is to be connected with
the construction of the latter high road, though its date is not
certainly known. The further history of Roman supremacy
in Italy will be found in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rome</a></span>: <i>History</i>. We notice,
however, that the continual warfare in which the Roman state
was engaged led to the decadence of the free population of
Latium, and that the extension of the empire of Rome was
fatal to the prosperity of the territory which immediately surrounded
the city.<a name="fa16c" id="fa16c" href="#ft16c"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>

<p>What had previously, it seems, been a well-peopled region,
with peasant proprietors, kept healthy by careful drainage,
became in the 4th and 3rd centuries <span class="scs">B.C.</span> a district
consisting in large measure of huge estates (<i>latifundia</i>)
<span class="sidenote">Causes of depopulation.</span>
owned by the Roman aristocracy, cultivated by gangs
of slaves. This led to the disappearance of the agricultural
population, to a decline in public safety, and to the
spread of malaria in many parts; indeed, it is quite possible that
it was not introduced into Latium before the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
The evil increased in the later period of the Republic, and
many of the old towns of Latium sank into a very decayed
condition; with this the continual competition of the provinces
as sources of food-supply no doubt had a good deal to do. Cicero
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
speaks of Gabii, Labici and Bovillae as places that had fallen into
abject poverty, while Horace refers to Gabii and Fidenae as mere
&ldquo;deserted villages,&rdquo; and Strabo as &ldquo;once fortified towns, but
now villages, belonging to private individuals.&rdquo; Many of the
smaller places mentioned in the list of Dionysius, or the early
wars of the Romans, had altogether ceased to exist, but the
statement of Pliny that fifty-three communities (<i>populi</i>) had thus
perished within the boundaries of Old Latium is perhaps exaggerated.
By the end of the Republic a good many parts of
Latium were infected, and Rome itself was highly malarious in the
warm months (see W. H. S. Jones in <i>Annals of Archaeology and
Anthropology</i>, ii. 97, Liverpool, 1909). The emperors Claudius,
Nerva and Trajan turned their attention to the district, and under
their example and exhortation the Roman aristocracy erected
numerous villas within its boundaries, and used them at least
for summer residences. During the 2nd century the Campagna
seems to have entered on a new era of prosperity. The system of
roads radiating in all directions from Rome (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Italy</a></span>: <i>History</i>,
¬ß B) belonged to a much earlier period; but they were connected
by a network of crossroads (now mostly abandoned,
while the main lines are still almost all in use) leading to the very
numerous villas with which the Campagna was strewn (even
in districts which till recently were devastated by malaria),
and which seem in large measure to belong to this period. Some
of these are of enormous extent, <i>e.g.</i> the villa of the Quintilii
on the Via Appia, that known as Setta Bassi on the Via Latina,
and that of Hadrian near Tibur, the largest of all.</p>

<p>When the land tax was introduced into Italy in 292, the first
region of Augustus obtained the name of <i>provincia Campania</i>.
Later on the name Latium entirely disappeared, and the name
Campania extended as far as Veii and the Via Aurelia, whence
the medieval and modern name Campagna di Roma. The
donation made by Constantine to various churches of Rome
of numerous estates belonging to the <i>patrimonium Caesaris</i> in
the neighbourhood of Rome was of great historical importance,
as being the origin of the territorial dominion of the papacy.
His example was followed by others, so that the church property
in the Campagna soon became considerable; and, owing to the
immunities and privileges which it enjoyed, a certain revival
of prosperity ensued. The invasions of the barbarian hordes
did great harm, but the formation of centres (<i>domuscultae</i>) in
the 8th and 9th centuries was a fact of great importance: the
inhabitants, indeed, formed the medieval militia of the papacy.
Smaller centres (the <i>colonia</i>&mdash;often formed in the remains of an
ancient villa&mdash;the <i>curtis</i> or <i>curia</i>, the <i>castrum</i>, the <i>casale</i>) grew
up later. We may note that, owing to the growth of the
temporal power of the popes, there was never a <i>dux Romae</i>
dependent on the exarchate of Ravenna, similar to those established
by Narses in the other districts of Italy.</p>

<p>The papal influence was also retained by means of the suburban
bishoprics, which took their rise as early as the 4th and 5th
centuries. The rise of the democratic commune of
Rome<a name="fa17c" id="fa17c" href="#ft17c"><span class="sp">17</span></a> about 1143 and of the various trade corporations
<span class="sidenote">Under the commune.</span>
which we already find in the early 11th century
led to struggles with the papacy; the commune of
Rome made various attempts to exercise supremacy in the
Campagna and levied various taxes from the 12th century until
the 15th. The commune also tried to restrict the power of
the barons, who, in the 13th century especially, though we find
them feudatories of the holy see from the 10th century onwards,
threatened to become masters of the whole territory, which is
still dotted over with the baronial castles and lofty solitary
towers of the rival families of Rome&mdash;Orsini, Colonna, Savelli,
Conti, Caetani&mdash;who ruthlessly destroyed the remains of earlier
edifices to obtain materials for their own, and whose castles,
often placed upon the high roads, thus following a strategic
line to a stronghold in the country, did not contribute to the
undisturbed security of traffic upon them, but rather led to their
abandonment. On a list of the inhabited centres of the Campagna
of the 14th century with the amount of salt (which was
a monopoly of the commune of Rome) consumed by each,
Tomassetti bases an estimate of the population: this was about
equal to that of our own times, but differently distributed, some
of the smaller centres having disappeared at the expense of the
towns. Several of the popes, as Sixtus IV. and Julius III.,
made unsuccessful attempts to improve the condition of the
Campagna, the former making a serious attempt to revive
agriculture as against pasture, while in the latter part of the
16th century a line of watch-towers was erected along the coast.
In the Renaissance, it is true, falls the erection of many fine
villas in the neighbourhood of Rome&mdash;not only in the hills
round the Campagna, but even in certain places in the lower
ground, <i>e.g.</i> those of Julius II. at La Magliana and of Cardinal
Trivulzio at Salone,&mdash;and these continued to be frequented
until the end of the 18th century, when the French Revolution
dealt a fatal blow to the prosperity of the Roman nobility.
The 17th and 18th centuries, however, mark the worst period
of depopulation in the more malarious parts of the Campagna,
which seems to have begun in the 15th century, though we hear
of malaria throughout the middle ages. The most healthy
portions of the territory are in the north and east, embracing
the slopes of the Apennines which are watered by the Teverone
and Sacco; and the most pestilential is the stretch between the
Monti Lepini and the sea. The Pontine Marshes (<i>q.v</i>.) included
in the latter division, were drained, according to the plan of
Bolognini, by Pius VI., who restored the ancient Via Appia to
<span class="sidenote">Modern conditions]</span>
traffic; but though they have returned to pasture
and cultivation, their insalubrity is still notorious.
The soil in many parts is very fertile and springs are
plentiful and abundant: the water is in some cases
sulphureous or ferruginous. In summer, indeed, the vast expanse
is little better than an arid steppe; but in the winter it furnishes
abundant pasture to flocks of sheep from the Apennines and
herds of silver-grey oxen and shaggy black horses, and sheep
passing in the summer to the mountain pastures. A certain
amount of horse-breeding is done, and the government has, as
elsewhere in Italy, a certain number of stallions. Efforts have
been made since 1882 to cure the waterlogged condition of the
marshy grounds. The methods employed have been three&mdash;(i.)
the cutting of drainage channels and clearing the marshes
by pumping, the method principally employed; (ii.) the system
of warping, <i>i.e.</i> directing a river so that it may deposit its
sedimentary matter in the lower-lying parts, thus levelling them
up and consolidating them, and then leading the water away again
by drainage; (iii.) the planting of firs and eucalyptus trees,
<i>e.g.</i> at Tre Fontane and elsewhere. These efforts have not been
without success, though it cannot be affirmed that the malarial
Campagna is anything like healthy yet. The regulation of the
rivers, more especially of the Tiber, is probably the most efficient
method for coping with the problem. Since 1884 the Italian
Government have been systematically enclosing, pumping dry
and generally draining the marshes of the Agro Romano, that is,
the tracts around Ostia; the Isola Sacra, at the mouth of the
Tiber; and Maccarese. Of the whole of the Campagna less
than one-tenth comes annually under the plough. In its picturesque
desolation, contrasting so strongly with its prosperity
in Roman times, immediately surrounding a city of over half a
million inhabitants, and with lofty mountains in view from all
parts of it, it is one of the most interesting districts in the world,
and has a peculiar and indefinable charm. The modern province
of Rome (forming the <i>compartimento</i> of Lazio) includes also
considerable mountain districts, extending as far N.W. as the
Lake of Bolsena, and being divided on the N.E. from Umbria
by the Tiber, while on the E. it includes a considerable part of
the Sabine mountains and Apennines. The ancient district
of the Hernicans, of which Alatri is regarded as the centre, is
known as the Ciociaria, from a kind of sandals (<i>cioce</i>) worn by the
peasants. On the S.E. too a considerable proportion of the
group of the Lepini belongs to the province. The land is for the
most part let by the proprietors to <i>mercanti di Campagna</i>, who
employ a subordinate class of factors (<i>fattori</i>) to manage their
affairs on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span></p>

<p>The recent discovery that the malaria which has hitherto
rendered parts of the Campagna almost uninhabitable during
the summer is propagated by the mosquito (<i>Anopheles
claviger</i>) marks a new epoch; the most diverse theories
<span class="sidenote">Malaria.</span>
as to its origin had hitherto been propounded, but it is now
possible to combat it on a definite plan, by draining the marshes,
protecting the houses by fine mosquito-proof wire netting (for
<i>Anopheles</i> is not active by day), improving the water supply, &amp;c.,
while for those who have fever, quinine (now sold cheaply by the
state) is a great specific. A great improvement is already
apparent; and a law carried in 1903 for the <i>Bonifica dell&rsquo; Agro
Romano</i> compels the proprietors within a radius of some 6 m.
of Rome to cultivate their lands in a more productive way than
has often hitherto been the case, exemption from taxes for ten
years and loans at 2-1/2% from the government being granted
to those who carry on improvements, and those who refuse
being expropriated compulsorily. The government further
resolved to open roads and schools and provide twelve additional
doctors. Much is done in contending against malaria by the
Italian Red Cross Society. In 1900 31% of the inhabitants
of the Agro Romano had been fever-stricken; since then the
figure has rapidly decreased (5.1% in 1905).</p>

<p>The wheat crop in 1906 in the Agro Romano was 8,108,500
bushels, the Indian corn 3,314,000 bushels, the wine 12,100,000
gallons and the olive oil 1,980,000 gallons,&mdash;these
last two from the hill districts. The wine production
<span class="sidenote">Produce.</span>
had declined by one-half from the previous year, exportation
having fallen off in the whole country. 1907, however, was a
year of great overproduction all over Italy. The wine of the
Alban hills is famous in modern as in ancient times, but will not
as a rule bear exportation. The forests of the Alban hills and
near the coast produce much charcoal and light timber, while
the Sabine and Volscian hills have been largely deforested and
are now bare limestone rocks. Much of the labour in the winter
and spring is furnished by peasants who come down from the
Volscian and Hernican mountains, and from Abruzzi, and
occupy sometimes caves, but more often the straw or wicker
huts which are so characteristic a feature of the Campagna.
The fixed population of the Campagna in the narrower sense
(as distinct from the hills) is less than 1000. Emigration to
America, especially from the Volscian and Hernican towns, is
now considerable.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>2. <span class="sc">Latium Novum Or Adjectum</span>, as it is termed by Pliny, comprised
the territories occupied in earlier times by the Volsci and
Hernici. It was for the most part a rugged and mountainous
country, extending at the back of Latium proper, from the frontier
of the Sabines to the sea-coast between Terracina and Sinuessa.
But it was not separated from the adjacent territories by any natural
frontier or physical boundaries, and it is only by the enumeration of
the towns in Pliny according to the division of Italy by Augustus
that we can determine its limits. It included the Hernican cities of
Anagnia, Ferentinum, Alatrium and Verulae&mdash;a group of mountain
strongholds on the north side of the valley of the Trerus (Sacco);
together with the Volscian cities on the south of the same valley,
and in that of the Liris, the whole of which, with the exception of its
extreme upper end, was included in the Volscian territory. Here were
situated Signia, Frusino, Fabrateria, Fregellae, Sora, Arpinum, Atina,
Aquinum, Casinum and Interamna; Anxur (Terracina) was the
only seaport that properly belonged to the Volscians, the coast from
thence to the mouth of the Liris being included in the territory of the
Aurunci, or Ausones as they were termed by Greek writers, who
possessed the maritime towns of Fundi, Formiae, Caieta and Minturnae,
together with Suessa in the interior, which had replaced their
more ancient capital of Aurunca. Sinuessa, on the sea-coast between
the Liris (Garigliano) and the Vulturnus, at the foot of the Monte
Massico, was the last town in Latium according to the official use of
the term and was sometimes assigned to Campania, while Suessa was
more assigned to Latium. On the other hand, as Nissen points out
(<i>Italische Landeskunde</i>, ii. 554), the Pons Campanus, by which the
Via Appia crossed the Savo some 9 m. S.E. of Sinuessa, indicates by
its name the position of the old Campanian frontier. In the interior
the boundary fell between Casinum and Teanum Sidicinum, at about
the 100th milestone of the Via Latina&mdash;a fact which led later to the
jurisdiction of the Roman courts being extended on every side to
the 100th mile from the city, and to this being the limit beyond
which banishment from Rome was considered to begin.</p>

<p>Though the Apennines comprised within the boundaries of
Latium do not rise to a height approaching that of the loftiest summits
of the central range, they attain to a considerable altitude, and
form steep and rugged mountain masses from 4000 to 5000 ft. high.
They are traversed by three principal valleys: (1) that of the Anio,
now called Teverone, which descends from above Subiaco to Tivoli,
where it enters the plain of the Campagna; (2) that of the Trerus
(Sacco), which has its source below Palestrina (Praeneste), and flows
through a comparatively broad valley that separates the main mass
of the Apennines from the Volscian mountains or Monti Lepini, till
it joins the Liris below Ceprano; (3) that of the Liris (Garigliano),
which enters the confines of New Latium about 20 m. from its source,
flows past the town of Sora, and has a very tortuous course from
thence to the sea at Minturnae; its lower valley is for the most part
of considerable width, and forms a fertile tract of considerable extent,
bordered on both sides by hills covered with vines, olives and fruit
trees, and thickly studded with towns and villages.</p>

<p>It may be observed that, long after the Latins had ceased to exist
as a separate people we meet in Roman writers with the phrase of
<i>nomen Latinum</i>, used not in an ethnical but a purely political sense,
to designate the inhabitants of all those cities on which the Romans
had conferred &ldquo;Latin rights&rdquo; (<i>jus Latinum</i>)&mdash;an inferior form of
the Roman franchise, which had been granted in the first instance
to certain cities of the Latins, when they became subjects of Rome,
and was afterwards bestowed upon many other cities of Italy,
especially the so-called Latin colonies. At a later period the same
privileges were extended to places in other countries also&mdash;as for
instance to most of the cities in Sicily and Spain. All persons enjoying
these rights were termed in legal phraseology <i>Latini</i> or <i>Latinae
conditionis</i>.</p>

Aeneas with the daughter of Latinus, king of the aborigines, and the

the historical significance of the NO- ethnicon (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sabini</a></span>) it is important
to observe that the original form of the ethnic adjective

<p><span class="bold">LATONA<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (Lat. form of Gr. <span class="grk" title="L√™t√¥">&#923;&#951;&#964;&#974;</span>, Leto), daughter of Coeus
and Phoebe, mother of Apollo and Artemis. The chief seats of
her legend are Delos and Delphi, and the generally accepted
tradition is a union of the legends of these two places. Leto,
pregnant by Zeus, seeks for a place of refuge to be delivered.
After long wandering she reaches the barren isle of Delos, which,
according to Pindar (Frag. 87, 88), was a wandering rock borne
about by the waves till it was fixed to the bottom of the sea for
the birth of Apollo and Artemis. In the oldest forms of the
legend Hera is not mentioned; but afterwards the wanderings
of Leto are ascribed to the jealousy of that goddess, enraged
at her amour with Zeus. The foundation of Delphi follows
immediately on the birth of the god; and on the sacred way
between Tempe and Delphi the giant Tityus offers violence to
Leto, and is immediately slain by the arrows of Apollo and
Artemis (<i>Odyssey</i>, xi. 576-581; Apollodorus i. 4). Such are the
main facts of the Leto legend in its common literary form,
which is due especially to the two Homeric hymns to Apollo.
But Leto is a real goddess, not a mere mythological figure.
The honour paid to her in Delphi and Delos might be explained
as part of the cult of her son Apollo; but temples to her existed
in Argos, in Mantineia and in Xanthus in Lycia; her sacred
grove was on the coast of Crete. In Lycia graves are frequently
placed under her protection, and she is also known as a goddess of
fertility and as <span class="grk" title="kourotrophos">&#954;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#972;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span>. It is to be observed that she appears
far more conspicuously in the Apolline myths than in those
which grew round the great centres of Artemis worship, the
reason being that the idea of Apollo and Artemis as twins is
one of later growth on Greek soil. Lycia, one of the chief seats
of the cult of Apollo, where most frequent traces are found of
the worship of Leto as the great goddess, was probably the earlier
home of her religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In Greek art Leto usually appears carrying her children in her arms,
pursued by the dragon sent by the jealous Hera, which is slain by
the infant Apollo; in vase paintings especially she is often represented
with Apollo and Artemis. The statue of Leto in the Leto√∂n
at Argos was the work of Praxiteles.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LATOUCHE, HYACINTHE JOSEPH ALEXANDRE THABAUD DE<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span>
[known as <span class="sc">Henri</span>] (1785-1851), French poet and
novelist, was born at La Ch√¢tre (Indre) on the 2nd of February
1785. Among his works may be distinguished his comedies:
<i>Projets de sagesse</i> (1811), and, in collaboration with √âmile
Deschamps, <i>Selmours de Florian</i> (1818), which ran for a hundred
nights; also <i>La Reine d&rsquo;Espagne</i> (1831), which proved too
indecent for the public taste; a novel, <i>Fragoletta: Naples et
Paris en 1799</i> (1829), which attained a success of notoriety;
<i>La Vall√©e aux coups</i> (1833), a volume of prose essays and verse;
and two volumes of poems, <i>Les Adieux</i> (1843) and <i>Les Agrestes</i>
(1844). Latouche&rsquo;s chief claim to remembrance is that he
revealed to the world the genius of Andr√© Ch√©nier, then only
known to a limited few. The remains of the poet&rsquo;s work had
passed from the hands of Daunou to Latouche, who had sufficient
critical insight instantly to recognize their value. In editing the
first selection of Ch√©nier&rsquo;s poems (1819) he made some trifling
emendations, but did not, as B√©ranger afterwards asserted, make
radical and unnecessary changes. Latouche was guilty of more
than one literary fraud. He caused a licentious story of his
own to be attributed to the duchesse de Duras, the irreproachable
author of <i>Ourika</i>. He made many enemies by malicious attacks
on his contemporaries. The <i>Constitutionnel</i> was suppressed in
1817 by the government for an obscure political allusion in an
article by Latouche. He then undertook the management of
the <i>Mercure du XIX<span class="sp">e</span> si√®cle</i>, and began a bitter warfare against
the monarchy. After 1830 he edited the <i>Figaro</i>, and spared
neither the liberal politicians nor the romanticists who triumphed
under the monarchy of July. In his turn he was violently
attacked by Gustave Planche in the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i>
for November 1831. But it must be remembered to the credit
of Latouche that he did much to encourage George Sand at the
beginning of her career. The last twenty years of his life were
spent in retirement at Aulnay, where he died on the 9th of
March 1851.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Sainte-Beuve, in the <i>Causeries du lundi</i>, vol. 3, gives a not too
sympathetic portrait of Latouche. See also George Sand in the

<p><span class="bold">LA TOUR, MAURICE QUENTIN DE<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> (1704-1788), French
pastellist, was born at St Quentin on the 5th of September 1704.
After leaving Picardy for Paris in 1727 he entered the studio of
Spo√®de&mdash;an upright man, but a poor master, rector of the
academy of St Luke, who still continued, in the teeth of the
Royal Academy, the traditions of the old gild of the master
painters of Paris. This possibly contributed to the adoption by
La Tour of a line of work foreign to that imposed by an academical
training; for pastels, though occasionally used, were not a
principal and distinct branch of work until 1720, when Rosalba
Carriera brought them into fashion with the Parisian world.
In 1737 La Tour exhibited the first of that splendid series of a
hundred and fifty portraits which formed the glory of the Salon
for the succeeding thirty-seven years. In 1746 he was received
into the academy; and in 1751, the following year to that
in which he received the title of painter to the king, he was
promoted by that body to the grade of councillor. His work
had the rare merit of satisfying at once both the taste of his
fashionable models and the judgment of his brother artists.
His art, consummate of its kind, achieved the task of flattering
his sitters, whilst hiding that flattery behind the just and striking
likeness which, says Pierre Jean Mariette, he hardly ever missed.
His portraits of Rousseau, of Voltaire, of Louis XV., of his queen,
of the dauphin and dauphiness, are at once documents and
masterpieces unsurpassed except by his life-size portrait of
Madame de Pompadour, which, exhibited at the Salon of 1755,
became the chief ornament of the cabinet of pastels in the Louvre.
The museum of St Quentin also possesses a magnificent collection
of works which at his death were in his own hands. La Tour
retired to St Quentin at the age of 80, and there he died on the
18th of February 1788. The riches amassed during his long life
were freely bestowed by him in great part before his death; he
founded prizes at the school of fine arts in Paris and for the
town of Amiens, and endowed St Quentin with a great number
of useful and charitable institutions. He never married, but
lived on terms of warm affection with his brother (who survived
him, and left to the town the drawings now in the museum);
and his relations to Mlle Marie Fel (1713-1789), the celebrated
singer, were distinguished by a strength and depth of feeling
not common to the loves of the 18th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA TOUR D&rsquo;AUVERGNE, TH√âOPHILE MALO<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (1743-1800),
French soldier, was born at Carhaix in Brittany on the 23rd of
December 1743, the son of an advocate named Corret. His
desire for a military career being strongly marked, he was enabled,
by the not uncommon device of producing a certificate
of nobility signed by his friends, first to be nominally enlisted in
the Maison du Roi, and soon afterwards to receive a commission
in the line, under the name of Corret de Kerbaufret. Four
years after joining, in 1771, he assumed by leave of the duke
of Bouillon the surname of La Tour d&rsquo;Auvergne, being in fact
descended from an illegitimate half-brother of the great Turenne.
Many years of routine service with his regiment were broken
only by his participation as a volunteer in the duc de Crillon&rsquo;s
Franco-Spanish expedition to Minorca in 1781. This led to an
offer of promotion into the Spanish army, but he refused to
change his allegiance. In <span class="correction" title="amended from 1748">1784</span> he was promoted captain, and in
1791 he received the cross of St Louis. In the early part of the
Revolution his patriotism was still more conspicuously displayed
in his resolute opposition to the proposals of many of his brother
officers in the Angoumois regiment to emigrate rather than to
swear to the constitution. In 1792 his lifelong interest in
numismatics and questions of language was shown by a work
which he published on the Bretons. At this time he was serving
under Montesquiou in the Alps, and although there was only
outpost fighting he distinguished himself by his courage and
audacity, qualities which were displayed in more serious fighting
in the Pyrenees the next year. He declined well-earned promotion
to colonel, and, being broken in health and compelled,
owing to the loss of his teeth, to live on milk, he left the army in
1795. On his return by sea to Brittany he was captured by the
English and held prisoner for two years. When released, he
settled at Passy and published <i>Origines gauloises</i>, but in 1797,
on the appeal of an old friend whose son had been taken as a
conscript, he volunteered as the youth&rsquo;s substitute, and served
on the Rhine (1797) and in Switzerland (1798-1799) as a captain.
In recognition of his singular bravery and modesty Carnot
obtained a decree from the first consul naming La Tour d&rsquo;Auvergne
&ldquo;first grenadier of France&rdquo; (27th of April 1800). This led him
to volunteer again, and he was killed in action at Oberhausen,
near Donauw√∂rth, on the 27th of June 1800.</p>

<p>La Tour d&rsquo;Auvergne&rsquo;s almost legendary courage had captivated
the imagination of the French soldier, and his memory was not
suffered to die. It was customary for the French troops and
their allies of the Rhine Confederation under Napoleon to march
at attention when passing his burial-place on the battlefield. His
heart was long carried by the grenadier company of his regiment,
the 46th; after being in the possession of Garibaldi for many
years, it was finally deposited in the keeping of the city of Paris
in 1883. But the most striking tribute to his memory is paid
to-day as it was by order of the first consul in 1800. &ldquo;His name
is to be kept on the pay list and roll of his company. It will be
called at all parades and a non-commissioned officer will reply,
<i>Mort au champ d&rsquo;honneur</i>.&rdquo; This custom, with little variation, is
still observed in the 46th regiment on all occasions when the
colour is taken on parade.</p>

found means of making himself known to the leading naturalists
there. His &ldquo;M√©moire sur les mutilles d√©couvertes en France,&rdquo;
contributed to the <i>Proceedings</i> of the Society of Natural History
in Paris, procured for him admission to that body. At the Revolution
he was compelled to quit Paris, and as a priest of
conservative sympathies suffered considerable hardship, being
imprisoned for some time at Bordeaux. His <i>Pr√©cis des caract√®res
g√©n√©riques des insectes, dispos√©s dans un ordre naturel</i>, appeared
at Brives in 1796. In 1798 he became a corresponding member
of the Institute, and at the same time was entrusted with the task
of arranging the entomological collection at the recently organized
Mus√©um d&rsquo;Histoire Naturelle (Jardin des Plantes); in 1814 he
succeeded G. A. Olivier as member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences,
and in 1821 he was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour.
For some time he acted as professor of zoology in the veterinary
school at Alfort near Paris, and in 1830, when the chair of
zoology of invertebrates at the Mus√©um was divided after the
death of Lamarck, Latreille was appointed professor of zoology
of crustaceans, arachnids and insects, the chair of molluscs,
worms and zoophytes being assigned to H. M. D. de Blainville.
&ldquo;On me donne du pain quand je n&rsquo;ai plus de dents,&rdquo; said
Latreille, who was then in his sixty-eighth year. He died in
Paris on the 6th of February 1833.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA TR√âMOILLE<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span>, an old French family which derives its name
from a village (the modern La Trimouille) in the department of
Vienne. The family has been known since the middle of the
11th century, and since the 14th century its members have been
conspicuous in French history. Guy, sire de la Tr√©moille,
standard-bearer of France, was taken prisoner at the battle of
Nicopolis (1396), and Georges, the favourite of King Charles VII.,
was captured at Agincourt (1415). Louis (2), called the <i>chevalier
sans reproche</i>, defeated and captured the duke of Orleans at the
battle of Saint Aubin-du-Cormier (1488), distinguished himself
in the wars in Italy, and was killed at Pavia (1525). In 1521
Fran√ßois (2) acquired a claim on the kingdom of Naples by his
marriage with Anne de Laval, daughter of Charlotte of Aragon.
Louis (3) became duke of Thouars in 1563, and his son Claude
turned Protestant, was created a peer of France in 1595, and
married a daughter of William the Silent in 1598. To this family
belonged the lines of the counts of Joigny, the marquises of
Royan and counts of Olonne, and the marquises and dukes of
Noirmoutier.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LATROBE, CHARLES JOSEPH<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> (1801-1875), Australian
governor, was born in London on the 20th of March 1801. The
Latrobes were of Huguenot extraction, and belonged to the
Moravian community, of which the father and grandfather of
C. J. Latrobe were ministers. His father, Christian Ignatius
Latrobe (1758-1836), a musician of some note, did good service
in the direction of popularizing classical music in England by his
<i>Selection of Sacred Music from the Works of the most Eminent
Composers of Germany and Italy</i> (6 vols., 1806-1825). C. J.
Latrobe was an excellent mountaineer, and made some important
ascents in Switzerland in 1824-1826. In 1832 he went to
America with Count Albert Pourtales, and in 1834 crossed the
prairies from New Orleans to Mexico with Washington Irving.
In 1837 he was invested with a government commission in the
West Indies, and two years later was made superintendent of
the Port Philip district of New South Wales. When Port Philip
was erected into a separate colony as Victoria in 1851, Latrobe
became lieutenant-governor. The discovery of gold in that year
attracted enormous numbers of immigrants annually. Latrobe
discharged the difficult duties of government at this critical
period with tact and success. He retired in 1854, became C.B.
in 1858 and died in London on the 2nd of December 1875.
Beside some volumes of travel he published a volume of poems,
<i>The Solace of Song</i> (1837).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LATUDE, JEAN HENRI,<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> often called <span class="sc">Danry</span> or <span class="sc">Masers de
Latude</span> (1725-1805), prisoner of the Bastille, was born at
Montagnac in Gascony on the 23rd of March 1725. He received
a military education and went to Paris in 1748 to study mathematics.
He led a dissipated life and endeavoured to curry favour
with the marquise de Pompadour by secretly sending her a box
of poison and then informing her of the supposed plot against her
life. The ruse was discovered, and Mme de Pompadour, not
appreciating the humour of the situation, had Latude put in the
Bastille on the 1st of May 1749. He was later transferred to
Vincennes, whence he escaped in 1750. Retaken and reimprisoned
in the Bastille, he made a second brief escape in 1756.
He was transferred to Vincennes in 1764, and the next year made
a third escape and was a third time recaptured. He was put in
a madhouse by Malesherbes in 1775, and discharged in 1777 on
condition that he should retire to his native town. He remained
in Paris and was again imprisoned. A certain Mme Legros
became interested in him through chance reading of one of his
memoirs, and, by a vigorous agitation in his behalf, secured his
definite release in 1784. He exploited his long captivity with
considerable ability, posing as a brave officer, a son of the
marquis de la Tude, and a victim of Pompadour&rsquo;s intrigues.
He was extolled and pensioned during the Revolution, and in
1793 the convention compelled the heirs of Mme de Pompadour
to pay him 60,000 francs damages. He died in obscurity at Paris
on the 1st of January 1805.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The principal work of Latude is the account of his imprisonment,
written in collaboration with an advocate named Thi√©ry, and entitled

d√©tenu pendant trente-cinq ans dans les diverses prisons d&rsquo;√©tat</i> (Amsterdam,

<p><span class="bold">LAUBE, HEINRICH<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (1806-1884), German dramatist, novelist
and theatre-director, was born at Sprottau in Silesia on the
18th of September 1806. He studied theology at Halle and
Breslau (1826-1829), and settled in Leipzig in 1832. Here he
at once came into prominence with his political essays, collected
under the title <i>Das neue Jahrhundert</i>, in two parts&mdash;<i>Polen</i> (1833)
and <i>Politische Briefe</i> (1833)&mdash;and with the novel <i>Das junge
Europa</i>, in three parts&mdash;<i>Die Poeten</i>, <i>Die Krieger</i>, <i>Die B√ºrger</i>&mdash;(1833-1837).
These writings, in which, after the fashion of
Heinrich Heine and Ludwig B√∂rne, he severely criticized the
political r√©gime in Germany, together with the part he played
in the literary movement known as <i>Das junge Deutschland</i>, led
to his being subjected to police surveillance and his works confiscated.
On his return, in 1834, from a journey to Italy, undertaken
in the company of Karl Gutzkow, Laube was expelled
from Saxony and imprisoned for nine months in Berlin. In
1836 he married the widow of Professor H√§nel of Leipzig;
almost immediately afterwards he suffered a year&rsquo;s imprisonment
for his revolutionary sympathies. In 1839 he again settled
in Leipzig and began a literary activity as a playwright. Chief
among his earlier productions are the tragedies <i>Monaldeschi</i>
(1845) and <i>Struensee</i> (1847); the comedies <i>Rokoko, oder die alten
Herren</i> (1846); <i>Gottsched und Gellert</i> (1847); and <i>Die Karlssch√ºler</i>
(1847), of which the youthful Schiller is the hero. In
1848 Laube was elected to the national assembly at Frankfort-on-Main
for the district of Elbogen, but resigned in the spring
of 1849, when he was appointed artistic director of the Hofburg
theatre in Vienna. This office he held until 1867, and in this
period fall his finest dramatic productions, notably the tragedies
<i>Graf Essex</i> (1856) and <i>Montrose</i> (1859), and his historical romance
<i>Der deutsche Krieg</i> (1865-1866, 9 vols.), which graphically
pictures a period in the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. In 1869 he became
director of the Leipzig Stadttheater, but returned to Vienna
in 1870, where in 1872 he was placed at the head of the new
Stadttheater; with the exception of a short interval he managed
this theatre with brilliant success until his retirement from
public life in 1880. He has left a valuable record of his work
in Vienna and Leipzig in the three volumes <i>Das Burgtheater</i>
(1868), <i>Das norddeutsche Theater</i> (1872) and <i>Das Wiener Stadttheater</i>
(1875). His pen was still active after his retirement,
and in the five years preceding his death, which took place at
Vienna on the 1st of August 1884, he wrote the romances and
novels <i>Die B√∂hminger</i> (1880), <i>Louison</i> (1881), <i>Der Schatten-Wilhelm</i>
(1883), and published an interesting volume of reminiscences,
<i>Erinnerungen, 1841-1881</i> (1882). Laube&rsquo;s dramas
are not remarkable for originality or for poetical beauty; their
real and great merit lies in their stage-craft. As a theatre-manager
he has had no equal in Germany, and his services in
this capacity have assured him a more lasting name in German
literary history than his writings.</p>

to treat with the Huguenots in the king&rsquo;s name. His son
Guillaume was a councillor of state and ambassador to England.

<p><span class="bold">LAUD, WILLIAM<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> (1573-1645), English archbishop, only son
of William Laud, a clothier, was born at Reading on the 7th of
October 1573. He was educated at Reading free school, matriculated
at St John&rsquo;s college, Oxford, in 1589, gained a scholarship
in 1590, a fellowship in 1593, and graduated B.A. in 1594,
proceeding to D.D. in 1608. In 1601 he took orders, in 1603
becoming chaplain to Charles Blount, earl of Devonshire. Laud
early took up a position of antagonism to the Calvinistic party
in the church, and in 1604 was reproved by the authorities for
maintaining in his thesis for the degree of B.D. &ldquo;that there
could be no true church without bishops,&rdquo; and again in 1606
for advocating &ldquo;popish&rdquo; opinions in a sermon at St Mary&rsquo;s.
If high-church doctrines, however, met with opposition at
Oxford, they were relished elsewhere, and Laud obtained rapid
advancement. In 1607 he was made vicar of Stanford in Northamptonshire,
and in 1608 he became chaplain to Bishop Neile,
who in 1610 presented him to the living of Cuxton, when he
resigned his fellowship. In 1611, in spite of the influence of
Archbishop Abbot and Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, Laud was
made president of St John&rsquo;s, and in 1614 obtained in addition
the prebend of Buckden, in 1615 the archdeaconry of Huntingdon,
and in 1616 the deanery of Gloucester. Here he repaired
the fabric and changed the position of the communion table, a
matter which aroused great religious controversy, from the centre
of the choir to the east end, by a characteristic tactless exercise
of power offending the bishop, who henceforth refused to enter the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>277</span>
cathedral. In 1617 he went with the king to Scotland, and
aroused hostility by wearing the surplice. In 1621 he became
bishop of St David&rsquo;s, when he resigned the presidentship of St
John&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>In April 1622 Laud, by the king&rsquo;s orders, took part in a controversy
with Percy, a Jesuit, known as Fisher, the aim of
which was to prevent the conversion of the countess of Buckingham,
the favourite&rsquo;s mother, to Romanism, and his opinions
expressed on that occasion show considerable breadth and
comprehension. While refusing to acknowledge the Roman
Church as <i>the</i> true church, he allowed it to be <i>a</i> true church
and a branch of the Catholic body, at the same time emphasizing
the perils of knowingly associating with error; and with regard
to the English Church he denied that the acceptance of all its
articles was necessary. The foundation of belief was the Bible,
not any one branch of the Catholic church arrogating to itself
infallibility, and when dispute on matters of faith arose, &ldquo;a
lawful and free council, determining according to Scripture, is
the best judge on earth.&rdquo; A close and somewhat strange intimacy,
considering the difference in the characters and ideals of the
two men, between Laud and Buckingham now began, and proved
the chief instrument of Laud&rsquo;s advancement. The opportunity
came with the old king&rsquo;s death in 1625, for James, with all his
pedantry, was too wise and cautious to embark in Laud&rsquo;s rash
undertakings, and had already shown a prudent moderation,
after setting up bishops in Scotland, in going no further in
opposition to the religious feelings of the people. On the accession
of Charles, Laud&rsquo;s ambitious activities were allowed
free scope. A list of the clergy was immediately prepared by
him for the king, in which each name was labelled with an O
or a P, distinguishing the Orthodox to be promoted from the
Puritans to be suppressed. Laud defended Richard Montague,
who had aroused the wrath of the parliament by his pamphlet
against Calvinism. His influence soon extended into the domain
of the state. He supported the king&rsquo;s prerogative throughout
the conflict with the parliament, preached in favour of it before
Charles&rsquo;s second parliament in 1626, and assisted in Buckingham&rsquo;s
defence. In 1626 he was nominated bishop of Bath and
Wells, and in July 1628 bishop of London. On the 12th of April
1629 he was made chancellor of Oxford University.</p>

<p>In the patronage of learning and in the exercise of authority
over the morals and education of youth Laud was in his proper
sphere, many valuable reforms at Oxford being due to his
activity, including the codification of the statutes, the statute
by which public examinations were rendered obligatory for university
degrees, and the ordinance for the election of proctors,
the revival of the college system, of moral and religious discipline
and order, and of academic dress. He founded or endowed
various professorships, including those of Hebrew and Arabic,
and the office of public orator, encouraged English and foreign
scholars, such as Voss, Selden and Jeremy Taylor, founded
the university printing press, procuring in 1633 the royal patent
for Oxford, and obtained for the Bodleian library over 1300
MSS., adding a new wing to the building to contain his gifts. His
rule at Oxford was marked by a great increase in the number of
students. In his own college he erected the new buildings, and
was its second founder. Of his chancellorship he himself wrote
a history, and the Laudian tradition long remained the great
standard of order and good government in the university.
Elsewhere he showed his liberality and his zeal for reform. He
was an active visitor of Eton and Winchester, and endowed the
grammar school at Reading, where he was himself educated.
In London he procured funds for the restoration of the dilapidated
cathedral of St Paul&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He was far less great as a ruler in the state, showing as a
judge a tyrannical spirit both in the star chamber and high-commission
court, threatening Felton, the assassin of Buckingham,
with the rack, and showing special activity in procuring a
cruel sentence in the former court against Alexander Leighton
in June 1630 and against Henry Sherfield in 1634. His power
was greatly increased after his return from Scotland, whither he
had accompanied the king, by his promotion to the archbishopric
of Canterbury in August 1633. &ldquo;As for the state indeed,&rdquo; he
wrote to Wentworth on this occasion, &ldquo;I am for <i>Thorough</i>.&rdquo;
In 1636 the privy council decided in his favour his claim of
jurisdiction as visitor over both universities. Soon afterwards
he was placed on the commission of the treasury and on the
committee of the privy council for foreign affairs. He was all-powerful
both in church and state. He proceeded to impose
by authority the religious ceremonies and usages to which he
attached so much importance. His vicar-general, Sir Nathaniel
Brent, went through the dioceses of his province, noting every
dilapidation and every irregularity. The pulpit was no longer
to be the chief feature in the church, but the communion table.
The Puritan lecturers were suppressed. He showed great
hostility to the Puritan sabbath and supported the reissue of the
<i>Book of Sports</i>, especially odious to that party, and severely
reprimanded Chief Justice Richardson for his interference with
the Somerset wakes. He insisted on the use of the prayer-book
among the English soldiers in the service of Holland, and forced
strict conformity on the church of the merchant adventurers
at Delft, endeavouring even to reach the colonists in New
England. He tried to compel the Dutch and French refugees
in England to unite with the Church of England, advising double
taxation and other forms of persecution. In 1634 the justices
of the peace were ordered to enter houses to search for persons
holding conventicles and bring them before the commissioners.
He took pleasure in displaying his power over the great, and in
punishing them in the spiritual courts for moral offences. In
1637 he took part in the sentence of the star chamber on Prynne,
Bastwick and Burton, and in the same year in the prosecution
of Bishop Williams. He urged Strafford in Ireland to carry out
the same reforms and severities.</p>

<p>He was now to extend his ecclesiastical system to Scotland,
where during his visits the appearance of the churches had
greatly displeased him. The new prayer-book and canons were
drawn up by the Scottish bishops with his assistance and enforced
in the country, and, though not officially connected with the
work, he was rightly regarded as its real author. The attack
not only on the national religion, but on the national independence
of Scotland, proved to be the point at which the system,
already strained, broke and collapsed. Laud continued to
support Strafford&rsquo;s and the king&rsquo;s arbitrary measures to the last,
and spoke in favour of the vigorous continuation of the war on
Strafford&rsquo;s side in the memorable meeting of the committee of
eight on the 5th of May 1640, and for the employment of any
means for carrying it on. &ldquo;Tried all ways,&rdquo; so ran the notes of
his speech, &ldquo;and refused all ways. By the law of God and man
you should have subsistence and lawful to take it.&rdquo; Though
at first opposed to the sitting of convocation, after the dissolution
of parliament, as an independent body, on account of the opposition
it would arouse, he yet caused to be passed in it the new
canons which both enforced his ecclesiastical system and assisted
the king&rsquo;s divine right, resistance to his power entailing &ldquo;damnation.&rdquo;
Laud&rsquo;s infatuated policy could go no further, and the
<i>etcetera</i> oath, according to which whole classes of men were to be
forced to swear perpetual allegiance to the &ldquo;government of this
church by archbishops, bishops, deans and archdeacons, &amp;c.,&rdquo;
was long remembered and derided. His power now quickly
abandoned him. He was attacked and reviled as the chief
author of the troubles on all sides. In October he was ordered
by Charles to suspend the <i>etcetera</i> oath. The same month, when
the high commission court was sacked by the mob, he was
unable to persuade the star chamber to punish the offenders.
On the 18th of December he was impeached by the Long Parliament,
and on the 1st of March imprisoned in the tower. On the
12th of May, at Strafford&rsquo;s request, the archbishop appeared
at the window of his cell to give him his blessing on his way to
execution, and fainted as he passed by. For some time he was
left unnoticed in confinement. On the 31st of May 1643, however,
Prynne received orders from the parliament to search his
papers, and published a mutilated edition of his diary. The
articles of impeachment were sent up to the Lords in October,
the trial beginning on the 12th of March 1644, but the attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
to bring his conduct under a charge of high treason proving
hopeless, an attainder was substituted and sent up to the Lords
on the 22nd of November. In these proceedings there was no
semblance of respect for law or justice, the Lords yielding (4th of
January 1645) to the menaces of the Commons, who arrogated
to themselves the right to declare any crimes they pleased high
treason. Laud now tendered the king&rsquo;s pardon, which had been
granted to him in April 1643. This was rejected, and it was with
some difficulty that his petition to be executed with the axe,
instead of undergoing the ordinary brutal punishment for high
treason, was granted. He suffered death on the 10th of January
on Tower Hill, asserting his innocence of any offence known to
the law, repudiating the charge of &ldquo;popery,&rdquo; and declaring that
he had always lived in the Protestant Church of England. He
was buried in the chancel of All Hallows, Barking, whence his
body was removed on the 24th of July 1663 to the chapel of
St John&rsquo;s College, Oxford.</p>

<p>Laud never married. He is described by Fuller as &ldquo;low of
stature, little in bulk, cheerful in countenance (wherein gravity
and quickness were all compounded), of a sharp and piercing eye,
clear judgment and (abating the influence of age) firm memory.&rdquo;
His personality, on account of the sharp religious antagonisms
with which his name is inevitably associated, has rarely been
judged with impartiality. His severities were the result of a
narrow mind and not of a vindictive spirit, and their number
has certainly been exaggerated. His career was distinguished by
uprightness, by piety, by a devotion to duty, by courage and
consistency. In particular it is clear that the charge of partiality
for Rome is unfounded. At the same time the circumstances of
the period, the fact that various schemes of union with Rome
were abroad, that the missions of Panzani and later of Conn were
gathering into the Church of Rome numbers of members of the
Church of England who, like Laud himself, were dissatisfied with
the Puritan bias which then characterized it, the incident mentioned
by Laud himself of his being twice offered the cardinalate,
the movement carried on at the court in favour of Romanism,
and the fact that Laud&rsquo;s changes in ritual, however clearly
defined and restricted in his own intention, all tended towards
Roman practice, fully warranted the suspicions and fears of his
contemporaries. Laud&rsquo;s complete neglect of the national sentiment,
in his belief that the exercise of mere power was sufficient
to suppress it, is a principal proof of his total lack of true statesmanship.
The hostility to &ldquo;innovations in religion,&rdquo; it is
generally allowed, was a far stronger incentive to the rebellion
against the arbitrary power of the crown, than even the violation
of constitutional liberties; and to Laud, therefore, more than to
Strafford, to Buckingham, or even perhaps to Charles himself,
is especially due the responsibility for the catastrophe. He held
fast to the great idea of the catholicity of the English Church,
to that conception of it which regards it as a branch of the whole
Christian church, and emphasizes its historical continuity and
identity from the time of the apostles, but here again his policy
was at fault; for his despotic administration not only excited
and exaggerated the tendencies to separatism and independentism
which finally prevailed, but excluded large bodies of faithful
churchmen from communion with their church and from their
country. The emigration to Massachusetts in 1629, which
continued in a stream till 1640, was not composed of separatists
but of episcopalians. Thus what Laud grasped with one hand
he destroyed with the other.</p>

<p>Passing to the more indirect influence of Laud on his times,
we can observe a narrowness of mind and aim which separates
him from a man of such high imagination and idealism as
Strafford, however closely identified their policies may have
been for the moment. The chief feature of Laud&rsquo;s administration
is attention to countless details, to the most trivial of which he
attached excessive importance, and which are uninspired by
any great underlying principle. His view was always essentially
material. The one element in the church which to him was all
essential was its visibility. This was the source of his intense
dislike of the Puritan and Nonconformist conception of the
church, which afforded no tangible or definite form. Hence the
necessity for outward conformity, and the importance attached
to ritual and ceremony, unity in which must be established at
all costs, in contrast to dogma and doctrine, in which he showed
himself lenient and large-minded, winning over Hales by friendly
discussion, and encouraging the publication of Chillingworth&rsquo;s
<i>Religion of Protestants</i>. He was not a bigot, but a martinet.
The external form was with him the essential feature of religion,
preceding the spiritual conception, and in Laud&rsquo;s opinion being
the real foundation of it. In his last words on the scaffold he
alludes to the dangers and slanders he had endured labouring
to keep an uniformity in the external service of God; and Bacon&rsquo;s
conception of a spiritual union founded on variety and liberty was
one completely beyond his comprehension.</p>

<p>This narrow materialism was the true cause of his fatal
influence both in church and state. In his own character it
produced the somewhat blunted moral sense which led to the
few incidents in his career which need moral defence, his performance
of the marriage ceremony between his first patron Lord
Devonshire and the latter&rsquo;s mistress, the divorced wife of Lord
Rich, an act completely at variance with his principles; his
strange intimacy with Buckingham; his love of power and place.
Indistinguishable from his personal ambition was his passion
for the aggrandisement of the church and its predominance in
the state. He was greatly delighted at the foolish appointment
of Bishop Juxon as lord treasurer in 1636. &ldquo;No churchman had
it,&rdquo; he cries exultingly, &ldquo;since Henry VII.&rsquo;s time, ... and now
if the church will not hold up themselves under God, I can do no
more.&rdquo; Spiritual influence, in Laud&rsquo;s opinion, was not enough for
the church. The church as the guide of the nation in duty and
godliness, even extending its activity into state affairs as a
mediator and a moderator, was not sufficient. Its power must be
material and visible, embodied in great places of secular administration
and enthroned in high offices of state. Thus the church,
descending into the political arena, became identified with the
doctrines of one political party in the state&mdash;doctrines odious
to the majority of the nation&mdash;and at the same time became
associated with acts of violence and injustice, losing at once its
influence and its reputation. Equally disastrous to the state was
the identification of the king&rsquo;s administration with one party
in the church, and that with the party in an immense minority
not only in the nation but even among the clergy themselves.</p>

author, only son of Sir Andrew Lauder, 6th baronet, was born
at Edinburgh in 1784. He succeeded to the baronetcy in 1820.
His first contribution to <i>Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine</i> in 1817, entitled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>
&ldquo;Simon Roy, Gardener at Dunphail,&rdquo; was by some ascribed to
Sir Walter Scott. His paper (1818) on &ldquo;The Parallel Roads of
Glenroy,&rdquo; printed in vol. ix. of the <i>Transactions of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh</i>, first drew attention to the phenomenon
in question. In 1825 and 1827 he published two romances,
<i>Lochandhu</i> and the <i>Wolf of Badenoch</i>. He became a frequent
contributor to <i>Blackwood</i> and also to <i>Tait&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, and in
1830 he published <i>An Account of the Great Floods of August 1829 in
the Province of Moray and adjoining Districts</i>. Subsequent works
were <i>Highland Rambles, with Long Tales to Shorten the Way</i> (2 vols.
8vo, 1837), <i>Legendary Tales of the Highlands</i> (3 vols, 12mo,
1841), <i>Tour round the Coasts of Scotland</i> (1842) and <i>Memorial
of the Royal Progress in Scotland</i> (1843). Vol. i. of a <i>Miscellany
of Natural History</i>, published in 1833, was also partly prepared
by Lauder. He was a Liberal, and took an active interest in
politics; he held the office of secretary to the Board of Scottish
Manufactures. He died on the 29th of May 1848. An unfinished
series of papers, written for <i>Tait&rsquo;s Magazine</i> shortly before his
death, was published under the title <i>Scottish Rivers</i>, with a preface
by John Brown, M.D., in 1874.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAUDER, WILLIAM<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> (d. 1771), Scottish literary forger, was
born in the latter part of the 17th century, and was educated
at Edinburgh university, where he graduated in 1695. He
applied unsuccessfully for the post of professor of humanity
there, in succession to Adam Watt, whose assistant he had been
for a time, and also for the keepership of the university library.
He was a good scholar, and in 1739, published <i>Poetarum Scotorum
Musae Sacrae</i>, a collection of poems by various writers, mostly
paraphrased from the Bible. In 1742 Lauder came to London.
In 1747 he wrote an article for the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i> to
prove that Milton&rsquo;s <i>Paradise Lost</i> was largely a plagiarism from
the <i>Adamus Exul</i> (1601) of Hugo Grotius, the <i>Sarcotis</i> (1654) of
J. Masen (Masenius, 1606-1681), and the <i>Poemata Sacra</i> (1633)
of Andrew Ramsay (1574-1659). Lauder expounded his case
in a series of articles, and in a book (1753) increased the list of
plundered authors to nearly a hundred. But his success was
short-lived. Several scholars, who had independently studied
the alleged sources of Milton&rsquo;s inspiration, proved conclusively
that Lauder had not only garbled most of his quotations, but
had even inserted amongst them extracts from a Latin rendering
of <i>Paradise Lost</i>. This led to his exposure, and he was obliged
to write a complete confession at the dictation of his former
friend Samuel Johnson. After several vain endeavours to clear
his character he emigrated to Barbadoes, where he died in 1771.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAUDER,<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> a royal and police burgh of Berwickshire, Scotland.
Pop. (1901) 719. It is situated on the Leader, 29 m. S.E. of
Edinburgh by the North British railway&rsquo;s branch line from
Fountainhall, of which it is the terminus. The burgh is said to
date from the reign of William the Lion (1165-1214); its charter
was granted in 1502. In 1482 James III. with his court and
army rested here on the way to raise the siege of Berwick. While
the nobles were in the church considering grievances, Robert
Cochrane, recently created earl of Mar, one of the king&rsquo;s favourites,
whose &ldquo;removal&rdquo; was at the very moment under discussion,
demanded admittance. Archibald Douglas, earl of Angus,
opened the door and seized Mar, who was forthwith dragged to
Lauder Bridge and there, along with six other obnoxious
favourites, hanged in sight of his royal master. It was in
connexion with this exploit that Angus acquired the nickname of
&ldquo;Bell-the-cat.&rdquo; The public buildings include a town-hall and
a library. The parish church was built in 1673 by the earl of
Lauderdale, in exchange for the older edifice, the site of which
was required for the enlargement of Thirlestane castle, which,
originally a fortress, was then remodelled for a residence. The
town is a favourite with anglers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAUDERDALE, JOHN MAITLAND,<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> <span class="sc">Duke of</span> (1616-1682),
eldest surviving son of John Maitland, 2nd Lord Maitland of
Thirlestane (d. 1645), who was created earl of Lauderdale in 1624,
and of Lady Isabel Seton, daughter of Alexander, earl of
Dunfermline, and great-grandson of Sir Richard Maitland (<i>q.v.</i>),
the poet, a member of an ancient family of Berwickshire, was
born on the 24th of May 1616, at Lethington. He began public
life as a zealous adherent of the Presbyterian cause, took the
covenant, sat as an elder in the assembly at St Andrews in July
1643, and was sent to England as a commissioner for the covenant
in August, and to attend the Westminster assembly in November.
In February 1644 he was a member of the committee of both
kingdoms, and on the 20th of November was one of the commissioners
appointed to treat with the king at Uxbridge, when
he made efforts to persuade Charles to agree to the establishment
of Presbyterianism. In 1645 he advised Charles to reject the
proposals of the Independents, and in 1647 approved of the
king&rsquo;s surrender to the Scots. At this period Lauderdale
veered round completely to the king&rsquo;s cause, had several interviews
with him, and engaged in various projects for his restoration,
offering the aid of the Scots, on the condition of Charles&rsquo;s
consent to the establishment of Presbyterianism, and on the
26th of December he obtained from Charles at Carisbrooke
&ldquo;the engagement&rdquo; by which Presbyterianism was to be established
for three years, schismatics were to be suppressed, and
the acts of the Scottish parliament ratified, the king in addition
promising to admit the Scottish nobles into public employment
in England and to reside frequently in Scotland. Returning
to Scotland, in the spring of 1648, Lauderdale joined the party
of Hamilton in alliance with the English royalists. Their
defeat at Preston postponed the arrival of the prince of Wales,
but Lauderdale had an interview with the prince in the Downs
in August, and from this period obtained supreme influence over
the future king. He persuaded him later to accept the invitation
to Scotland from the Argyll faction, accompanied him thither
in 1650 and in the expedition into England, and was taken
prisoner at Worcester in 1651, remaining in confinement till
March 1660. He joined Charles in May 1660 at Breda, and, in
spite of the opposition of Clarendon and Monk, was appointed
secretary of state. From this time onwards he kept his hold
upon the king, was lodged at Whitehall, was &ldquo;never from the
king&rsquo;s ear nor council,&rdquo;<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and maintained his position against
his numerous adversaries by a crafty dexterity in dealing with
men, a fearless unscrupulousness, and a robust strength of will,
which overcame all opposition. Though a man of considerable
learning and intellectual attainment, his character was exceptionally
and grossly licentious, and his base and ignoble career was
henceforward unrelieved by a single redeeming feature. He
abandoned Argyll to his fate, permitted, if he did not assist in,
the restoration of episcopacy in Scotland, and after triumphing
over all his opponents in Scotland drew into his own hands the
whole administration of that kingdom, and proceeded to impose
upon it the absolute supremacy of the crown in church and
state, restoring the nomination of the lords of the articles to
the king and initiating severe measures against the Covenanters.
In 1669 he was able to boast with truth that &ldquo;the king is now
master here in all causes and over all persons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His own power was now at its height, and his position as the
favourite of Charles, controlled by no considerations of patriotism
or statesmanship, and completely independent of the English
parliament, recalled the worst scandals and abuses of the Stuart
administration before the Civil War. He was a member of the
cabal ministry, but took little part in English affairs, and was
not entrusted with the first secret treaty of Dover, but gave
personal support to Charles in his degrading demands for pensions
from Louis XIV. On the 2nd of May 1672 he was created
duke of Lauderdale and earl of March, and on the 3rd of June
knight of the garter. In 1673, on the resignation of James in
consequence of the Test Act, he was appointed a commissioner
for the admiralty. In October he visited Scotland to suppress
the dissenters and obtain money for the Dutch War, and the
intrigues organized by Shaftesbury against his power in his
absence, and the attacks made upon him in the House of Commons
in January 1674 and April 1675, were alike rendered futile by
the steady support of Charles and James. On the 25th of June
1674 he was created earl of Guilford and Baron Petersham in
the peerage of England. His ferocious measures having failed
to suppress the conventicles in Scotland, he summoned to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>
aid in 1677 a band of Highlanders, who were sent into the western
country. In consequence, a large party of Scottish nobles came
to London, made common cause with the English country
faction, and compelled Charles to order the disbandment of the
marauders. In May 1678 another demand by the Commons for
Lauderdale&rsquo;s removal was thrown out by court influence by one
vote. He maintained his triumphs almost to the end. In
Scotland, which he visited immediately after this victory in
parliament, he overbore all opposition to the king&rsquo;s demands
for money. Another address for his removal from the Commons
in England was suppressed by the dissolution of parliament on
the 26th of May 1679, and a renewed attack upon him, by the
Scottish party and Shaftesbury&rsquo;s faction combined, also failed.
On the 22nd of June 1679 the last attempt of the unfortunate
Covenanters was suppressed at Bothwell Brig. In 1680, however,
failing health obliged Lauderdale to resign the place and power
for which he had so long successfully struggled. His vote given
for the execution of Lord Stafford on the 29th of November is
said also to have incurred the displeasure of James. In 1682 he
was stripped of all his offices, and he died in August. Lauderdale
married (1) Lady Anne Home, daughter of the 1st earl of Home,
by whom he had one daughter; and (2) Lady Elizabeth Murray,
daughter of the 1st earl of Dysart and widow of Sir Lionel Tollemache.
He left no male issue, consequently his dukedom and
his English titles became extinct, but he was succeeded in the
earldom by his brother Charles (see below).</p>

<p>Charles Maitland, 3rd earl of Lauderdale (d. 1691), became an
ordinary lord of session as Lord Halton in 1669, afterwards assisting
his brother, the duke, in the management of public business in
Scotland. His eldest son, Richard (1653-1695), became the 4th earl.
As Lord Maitland he was lord-justice-general from 1681 to 1684; he
was an adherent of James II. and after fighting at the battle of the
Boyne he was an exile in France until his death. This earl made
a verse translation of Virgil (published 1737). He left no sons, and
his brother John (<i>c.</i> 1655-1710) became the 5th earl. John, a supporter
of William III. and of the union of England and Scotland,
was succeeded by his son Charles (<i>c.</i> 1688-1744), who was the grandfather
of James, the 8th earl.</p>

<p>James Maitland, 8th earl of Lauderdale (1759-1839), was a member
of parliament from 1780 until August 1789 when he succeeded his
father in the earldom. In the House of Commons he took an active
part in debate, and in the House of Lords, where he was a representative
peer for Scotland, he was prominent as an opponent of the
policy of Pitt and the English government with regard to France,
a country he had visited in 1792. In 1806 he was made a peer of the
United Kingdom as Baron Lauderdale of Thirlestane and for a
short time he was keeper of the great seal of Scotland. By this time
the earl, who had helped to found the Society of the Friends of the
People in 1792, had somewhat modified his political views; this
process was continued, and after acting as the leader of the Whigs in
Scotland, Lauderdale became a Tory and voted against the Reform
Bill of 1832. He died on the 13th of September 1839. He wrote an
<i>Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Public Wealth</i> (1804 and 1819), a
work which has been translated into French and Italian and which

and other writings of a similar nature. He was succeeded by his
sons James (1784-1860) and Anthony (1785-1863) as 9th and 10th
earls. Anthony, a naval officer, died unmarried in March 1863,
when his barony of the United Kingdom became extinct, but his
Scottish earldom devolved upon a cousin, Thomas Maitland (1803-1878),
a grandson of the 7th earl, who became 11th earl of Lauderdale.
Thomas, who was an admiral of the fleet, died without sons,
and the title passed to Charles Barclay-Maitland (1822-1884), a
descendant of the 6th earl. When Charles died unmarried, another
of the 6th earl&rsquo;s descendants, Frederick Henry Maitland (b. 1840),
became 13th earl of Lauderdale.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAUENBURG,<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> a duchy of Germany, formerly belonging with
Holstein to Denmark, but from 1865 to Prussia, and now included
in the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein. It lies
on the right bank of the Elbe, is bounded by the territories of
Hamburg, L√ºbeck, Mecklenburg-Strelitz and the province of
Hanover, and comprises an area of 453 sq. m. The surface is a
slightly undulating plain. The soil, chiefly alluvial, though in
some places arenaceous, is generally fertile and well cultivated,
but a great portion is covered with forests, interspersed with
lakes. By means of the Stecknitz canal, the Elbe, the principal
river, is connected with the Trave. The chief agricultural
products are timber, fruit, grain, hemp, flax and vegetables.
Cattle-breeding affords employment for many of the inhabitants.
The railroad from Hamburg to Berlin traverses the country.
The capital is Ratzeburg, and there are two other towns, M√∂lln
and Lauenburg.</p>

<p>The earliest inhabitants of Lauenburg were a Slav tribe, the
Polabes, who were gradually replaced by colonists from Saxony.
About the middle of the 12th century the country was subdued
by the duke of Saxony, Henry the Lion, who founded a bishopric
at Ratzeburg, and after Henry&rsquo;s fall in 1180 it formed part
of the smaller duchy of Saxony, which was governed by Duke
Bernhard. In 1203 it was conquered by Waldemar II., king of
Denmark, but in 1227 it reverted to Albert, a son of its former
duke. When Albert died in 1260 Saxony was divided. Lauenburg,
or Saxe-Lauenburg, as it is generally called, became a
separate duchy ruled by his son John, and had its own lines of
dukes for over 400 years, one of them, Magnus I. (d. 1543), being
responsible for the introduction of the reformed teaching into the
land. The reigning family, however, became extinct when Duke
Julius Francis died in September 1689, and there were at least
eight claimants for his duchy, chief among them being John
George III., elector of Saxony, and George William, duke of
Brunswick-L√ºneburg-Celle, the ancestors of both these princes
having made treaties of mutual succession with former dukes
of Saxe-Lauenburg. Both entered the country, but George
William proved himself the stronger and occupied Ratzeburg;
having paid a substantial sum of money to the elector, he was
recognized by the inhabitants as their duke. When he died
three years later Lauenburg passed to his nephew, George Louis,
elector of Hanover, afterwards king of Great Britain as George I.,
whose rights were recognized by the emperor Charles VI. in 1728.
In 1803 the duchy was occupied by the French, and in 1810 it
was incorporated with France. It reverted to Hanover after the
battle of Leipzig in 1813, and in 1816 was ceded to Prussia, the
greater part of it being at once transferred by her to Denmark in
exchange for Swedish Pomerania. In 1848, when Prussia made
war on Denmark, Lauenburg was occupied at her own request by
some Hanoverian troops, and was then administered for three
years under the authority of the German confederation, being
restored to Denmark in 1851. Definitely incorporated with this
country in 1853, it experienced another change of fortune
after the short war of 1864 between Denmark on the one side
and Prussia and Austria on the other, as by the peace of Vienna
(30th of October 1864) it was ceded with Schleswig and Holstein
to the two German powers. By the convention of Gastein (14th
of August 1865) Austria surrendered her claim to Prussia in
return for the payment of nearly ¬£300,000 and in September
1865 King William I. took formal possession of the duchy.
Lauenburg entered the North German confederation in 1866
and the new German empire in 1870. It retained its constitution
and its special privileges until the 1st of July 1876, when it
was incorporated with the kingdom of Prussia. In 1890 Prince
Bismarck received the title of duke of Lauenburg.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAUFF, JOSEF<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> (1855-&emsp;&emsp;), German poet and dramatist, was
born at Cologne on the 16th of November 1855, the son of a
jurist. He was educated at M√ºnster in Westphalia, and entering
the army served as a lieutenant of artillery at Thorn and subsequently
at Cologne, where he attained the rank of captain in
1890. In 1898 he was summoned by the German emperor,

William II., to Wiesbaden, being at the same time promoted to
major&rsquo;s rank, in order that he might devote his great dramatic
talents to the royal theatre. His literary career began with the
epic poems <i>Jan van Calker, ein Malerlied vom Niederrhein</i> (1887,
3rd ed., 1892) and <i>Der Helfensteiner, ein Sang aus dem Bauernkriege</i>
(3rd ed., 1896). These were followed by <i>Die Overstolzin</i>
(5th ed., 1900), <i>Herodias</i> (2nd ed., 1898) and the <i>Geislerin</i> (4th

1904), <i>Die Hauptmannsfrau</i> (8th ed., 1903) and <i>Marie Verwahnen</i>
(1903). But he is best known as a dramatist. Beginning with
the tragedy <i>Ignez de Castro</i> (1894), he proceeded to dramatize
the great monarchs of his country, and, in a Hohenzollern

<p><span class="bold">LAUNCESTON,<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough in
the Launceston parliamentary division of Cornwall, England,
35¬Ω m. N.W. of Plymouth, on branches of the Great Western
and the London &amp; South-Western railways. Pop. (1901) 4053.
It lies in a hilly district by and above the river Kensey, an
affluent of the Tamar, the houses standing picturesquely on
the southern slope of the narrow valley, with the keep of the
ancient castle crowning the summit. On the northern slope
lies the parish of St Stephen. The castle, the ruins of which
are in part of Norman date, was the seat of the earls of Cornwall,
and was frequently besieged during the civil wars of the 17th
century. In 1656 George Fox the Quaker was imprisoned in the
north-east tower for disturbing the peace at St Ives by distributing
tracts. Fragments of the old town walls and the south
gateway, of the Decorated period, are standing. The church
of St Mary Magdalen, built of granite, and richly ornamented
without, was erected early in the 16th century, but possesses
a detached tower dated 1380. A fine Norman doorway, now
appearing as the entrance to a hotel, is preserved from an
Augustinian priory founded in the reign of Henry I. The
parish church of St Stephen is Early English, and later, with
a Perpendicular tower. The trade of Launceston is chiefly
agricultural, but there are tanneries and iron foundries.
The borough is under a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors.
Area, 2189 acres.</p>

<p>A silver penny of √Üthelred II. witnesses to the fact that the
privilege of coining money was exercised by Launceston (Dunheved,
Lanscaveton, Lanstone) more than half a century before
the Norman conquest. At the time of the Domesday survey
the canons of St Stephen held Launceston, and the count of
Mortain held Dunheved. The number of families settled on
the former is not given, but attention is called to the market
which had been removed thence by the count to the neighbouring
castle of Dunheved, which had two mills, one villein and
thirteen bordars. A spot more favoured by nature could not
have been chosen either for settlement or for defence than the
rich lands near the confluence of the Kensey and Tamar, out
of which there rises abruptly the gigantic mound upon which
the castle is built. It is not known when the canons settled
here nor whether the count&rsquo;s castle, then newly erected, replaced
some earlier fortification. Reginald, earl of Cornwall (1140-1175),
granted to the canons rights of jurisdiction in all their
lands and exemption from suit of court in the shire and hundred
courts. Richard (1225-1272), king of the Romans, constituted
Dunheved a free borough, and granted to the burgesses freedom
from pontage, stallage and suillage, liberty to elect their own
reeves, exemption from all pleas outside the borough except
pleas of the crown, and a site for a gild-hall. The farm of the
borough was fixed at 100s. payable to the earl, 65s. to the prior
and 100s. 10d. to the lepers of St Leonard&rsquo;s. In 1205 the market
which had been held on Sunday was changed to Thursday.
An inquisition held in 1383 discloses two markets, a merchant
gild, pillory and tumbrel. In 1555 Dunheved, otherwise Launceston,
received a charter of incorporation, the common council
to consist of a mayor, 8 aldermen and a recorder. By its provisions
the borough was governed until 1835. The parliamentary
franchise which had been conferred in 1294 was confined to the
corporation and a number of free burgesses. In 1832 Launceston
was shorn of one of its members, and in 1885 merged in the
county. Separated from it by a small bridge over the Kensey
lies the hamlet of Newport which, from 1547 until 1832, also
returned two members. These were swept away when the
Reform Bill became law. Launceston was the assize town until
Earl Richard, having built a palace at Restormel, removed
the assize to Lostwithiel. In 1386 Launceston regained the
privilege by royal charter. From 1715 until 1837, eleven years
only excepted, the assize was held alternately here and at Bodmin.
Since that time Bodmin has enjoyed the distinction.
Launceston has never had a staple industry. The manufacture
of serge was considerable early in the 19th century. Its market
on Saturdays is well attended, and an ancient fair on the Feast
of St Thomas is among those which survive.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAUNCESTON,<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> the second city of Tasmania, in the county
of Cornwall, on the river Tamar, 40 m. from the N. coast of
the island, and 133 m. by rail N. by W. of Hobart. The city
lies amid surroundings of great natural beauty in a valley enclosed
by lofty hills. Cora Linn, about 6 m. distant, a deep
gorge of the North Esk river, the Punch Bowl and Cataract
Gorge, over which the South Esk falls in a magnificent cascade,
joining the North Esk to form the Tamar, are spots famed
throughout the Australian commonwealth for their romantic
beauty. The city is the commercial capital of northern Tasmania,
the river Tamar being navigable up to the town for
vessels of 4000 tons. The larger ships lie in midstream and
discharge into lighters, while vessels of 2000 tons can berth
alongside the wharves on to which the railway runs. Launceston
is a well-planned, pleasant town, lighted by electricity,
with numerous parks and squares and many fine buildings.
The post office, the custom house, the post office savings bank
and the Launceston bank form an attractive group; the town
hall is used exclusively for civic purposes, public meetings and
social functions being held in an elegant building called the
Albert hall. There are also a good art gallery, a theatre and
a number of fine churches, one of which, the Anglican church
of St John, dates from 1824. The city, which attained that rank
in 1889, has two attractive suburbs, Invermay and Trevallyn;
it has a racecourse at Mowbray 2 m. distant, and is the centre
and port of an important fruit-growing district. Pop. of the
city proper (1901) 18,022, of the city and suburbs 21,180.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAUNCH.<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (1) A verb meaning originally to hurl, discharge

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>
or rapidly. It is particularly used of the setting afloat a vessel
from the stocks on which she has been built. The word is an
adaptation of O. Fr. <i>lancher</i>, <i>lancier</i>, to hurl, throw, Lat. <i>lanceare</i>,
from <i>lancea</i>, a lance or spear. (2) The name of a particular
type of boat, usually applied to one of the largest size of ships&rsquo;
boats, or to a large boat moved by electricity, steam or other
power. The word is an adaptation of the Span. <i>lancha</i>, pinnace,
which is usually connected with <i>lanchara</i>, the Portuguese name,
common in 16th and 17th century histories, for a fast-moving
small vessel. This word is of Malay origin and is derived from
<i>lanch&#257;r</i>, quick, speedy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAUNDRY,<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> a place or establishment where soiled linen, &amp;c.,
is washed. The word is a contraction of an earlier form <i>lavendry</i>,
from Lat. <i>lavanda</i>, things to be washed, <i>lavare</i>, to wash.
&ldquo;Launder,&rdquo; a similar contraction of <i>lavender</i>, was one (of either
sex) who washes linen; from its use as a verb came the form
&ldquo;launderer,&rdquo; employed as both masculine and feminine in
America, and the feminine form &ldquo;laundress,&rdquo; which is also
applied to a female caretaker of chambers in the Inns of Court,
London.</p>

<p>Laundry-work has become an important industry, organized
on a scale which requires elaborate mechanical plant very
different from the simple appliances that once sufficed for
domestic needs. For the actual cleansing of the articles, instead
of being rubbed by the hand or trodden by the foot of the washerwoman,
or stirred and beaten with a &ldquo;dolly&rdquo; in the wash-tub,
they are very commonly treated in rotary washing machines
driven by power. These machines consist of an outer casing
containing an inner horizontal cylindrical cage, in which the
clothes are placed. By the rotation of this cage, which is reversed
by automatic gearing every few turns, they are rubbed and
tumbled on each other in the soap and water which is contained
in the outer casing and enters the inner cylinder through perforations.
The outer casing is provided with inlet valves for hot and
cold water, and with discharge valves; and often also arrangements
are made for the admission of steam under pressure, so that
the contents can be boiled. Thus the operations of washing,
boiling, rinsing and blueing (this last being the addition of a blue
colouring matter to mask the yellow tint and thus give the linen
the appearance of whiteness) can be performed without removing
the articles from the machine. For drying, the old methods of
wringing by hand, or by machines in which the clothes were
squeezed between rollers of wood or india-rubber, have been
largely superseded by &ldquo;hydro-extractors&rdquo; or &ldquo;centrifugals.&rdquo;
In these the wet garments are placed in a perforated cage or
basket, supported on vertical bearings, which is rotated at a
high speed (1000 to 1500 times a minute) and in a short time
as much as 85% of the moisture may thus be removed. The
drying is often completed in an apartment through which dry
air is forced by fans. In the process of finishing linen the old-fashioned
laundress made use of the mangle, about the only piece
of mechanism at her disposal. In the box-mangle the articles
were pressed on a flat surface by rollers which were weighted
with a box full of stones, moved to and fro by a rack and pinion.
In a later and less cumbrous form of the machine they were
passed between wooden rollers or &ldquo;bowls&rdquo; held close together
by weighted levers. An important advance was marked by
the introduction of machines which not only smooth and press
the linen like the mangle, but also give it the glazed finish
obtained by hot ironing. Machines of this kind are essentially
the same as the calenders used in paper and textile manufacture.
They are made in a great variety of forms, to enable them to
deal with articles of different shapes, but they may be described
generally as consisting either of a polished metal roller, heated
by steam or gas, which works against a blanketted or felted
surface in the form of another roller or a flat table, or, as in the
Decoudun type, of a felted metal roller rotating against a heated
concave bed of polished metal. In cases where hand-ironing
is resorted to, time is economized by the employment of irons
which are continuously heated by gas or electricity.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAUREATE<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> (Lat. <i>laureatus</i>, from <i>laurea</i>, the laurel tree).
The laurel, in ancient Greece, was sacred to Apollo, and as
such was used to form a crown or wreath of honour for
poets and heroes; and this usage has been widespread. The
word &ldquo;laureate&rdquo; or &ldquo;laureated&rdquo; thus came in English to
signify eminent, or associated with glory, literary or military.
&ldquo;Laureate letters&rdquo; in old times meant the despatches announcing
a victory; and the epithet was given, even officially (<i>e.g.</i> to
John Skelton) by universities, to distinguished poets. The name
of &ldquo;bacca-laureate&rdquo; for the university degree of bachelor shows
a confusion with a supposed etymology from Lat. <i>bacca lauri</i> (the
laurel berry), which though incorrect (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bachelor</a></span>) involves
the same idea. From the more general use of the term &ldquo;poet
laureate&rdquo; arose its restriction in England to the office of the
poet attached to the royal household, first held by Ben Jonson,
for whom the position was, in its essentials, created by Charles I.
in 1617. (Jonson&rsquo;s appointment does not seem to have been
formally made as poet-laureate, but his position was equivalent
to that). The office was really a development of the practice
of earlier times, when minstrels and versifiers were part of the
retinue of the King; it is recorded that Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion
had a <i>versificator regis</i> (Gulielmus Peregrinus), and Henry III.
had a versificator (Master Henry); in the 15th century John
Kay, also a &ldquo;versifier,&rdquo; described himself as Edward IV.&rsquo;s
&ldquo;humble poet laureate.&rdquo; Moreover, the crown had shown its
patronage in various ways; Chaucer had been given a pension
and a perquisite of wine by Edward III., and Spenser a pension
by Queen Elizabeth. W. Hamilton classes Chaucer, Gower,
Kay, Andrew Bernard, Skelton, Robert Whittington, Richard
Edwards, Spenser and Samuel Daniel, as &ldquo;volunteer Laureates.&rdquo;
Sir William Davenant succeeded Jonson in 1638, and the title of
poet laureate was conferred by letters patent on Dryden in 1670,
two years after Davenant&rsquo;s death, coupled with a pension of
¬£300 and a butt of Canary wine. The post then became a
regular institution, though the emoluments varied, Dryden&rsquo;s
successors being T. Shadwell (who originated annual birthday
and New Year odes), Nahum Tate, Nicholas Rowe, Laurence
Eusden, Colley Cibber, William Whitehead, Thomas Warton,
H. J. Pye, Southey, Wordsworth, Tennyson and, four years
after Tennyson&rsquo;s death, Alfred Austin. The office took on a new
lustre from the personal distinction of Southey, Wordsworth
and Tennyson; it had fallen into contempt before Southey,
and on Tennyson&rsquo;s death there was a considerable feeling that
no possible successor was acceptable (William Morris and
Swinburne being hardly court poets). Eventually, however, the
undesirability of breaking with tradition for temporary reasons,
and thus severing the one official link between literature and the
state, prevailed over the protests against following Tennyson by
any one of inferior genius. It may be noted that abolition was
similarly advocated when Warton and Wordsworth died.</p>

<p>The poet laureate, being a court official, was considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span>
responsible for producing formal and appropriate verses on
birthdays and state occasions; but his activity in this respect
has varied, according to circumstances, and the custom ceased
to be obligatory after Pye&rsquo;s death. Wordsworth stipulated,
before accepting the honour, that no formal effusions from
him should be considered a necessity; but Tennyson was
generally happy in his numerous poems of this class. The
emoluments of the post have varied; Ben Jonson first received
a pension of 100 marks, and later an annual &ldquo;terse of Canary
wine.&rdquo; To Pye an allowance of ¬£27 was made instead of the
wine. Tennyson drew ¬£72 a year from the lord chamberlain&rsquo;s
department, and ¬£27 from the lord steward&rsquo;s in lieu of the
&ldquo;butt of sack.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAUREL.<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> At least four shrubs or small trees are called by
this name in Great Britain, viz. the common or cherry laurel
(<i>Prunus Laurocerasus</i>), the Portugal laurel (<i>P. lusitanica</i>), the
bay or sweet laurel (<i>Laurus nobilis</i>) and the spurge laurel (<i>Daphne
Laureola</i>). The first two belong to the rose family (<i>Rosaceae</i>),
to the section <i>Cerasus</i> (to which also belongs the cherry) of the
genus <i>Prunus</i>.</p>

<p>The common laurel is a native of the woody and sub-alpine
regions of the Caucasus, of the mountains of northern Persia, of
north-western Asia Minor and of the Crimea. It was received
into Europe in 1576, and flowered for the first time in 1583.
Ray in 1688 relates that it was first brought from Trebizonde
to Constantinople, thence to Italy, France, Germany and
England. Parkinson in his <i>Paradisus</i> records it as growing in a
garden at Highgate in 1629; and in Johnson&rsquo;s edition of Gerard&rsquo;s
<i>Herbal</i> (1633) it is recorded that the plant &ldquo;is now got into many
of our choice English gardens, where it is well respected for the
beauty of the leaues and their lasting or continuall greennesse&rdquo;
(see Loudon&rsquo;s <i>Arboretum</i>, ii. 717). The leaves of this plant
are rather large, broadly lance-shaped and of a leathery consistence,
the margin being somewhat serrated. They are remarkable
for their poisonous properties, giving off the odour
of bitter almonds when bruised; the vapour thus issuing is
sufficient to kill small insects by the prussic acid which it contains.
The leaves when cut up finely and distilled yield oil of bitter
almonds and hydrocyanic (prussic) acid. Sweetmeats, custards,
cream, &amp;c., are often flavoured with laurel-leaf water, as it
imparts the same flavour as bitter almonds; but it should be
used sparingly, as it is a dangerous poison, having several times
proved fatal. The first case occurred in 1731, which induced a
careful investigation to be made of its nature; Schrader in
1802 discovered it to contain hydrocyanic acid. The effects of
the distilled laurel-leaf water on living vegetables is to destroy
them like ordinary prussic acid; while a few drops act on animals
as a powerful poison. It was introduced into the British pharmacopoeia
in 1839, but is generally superseded by the use of
prussic acid. The <i>aqua laurocerasi</i>, or cherry laurel water, is
now standardized to contain 0.1% of hydrocyanic acid. It
must not be given in doses larger than 2 drachms. It contains
benzole hydrate, which is antiseptic, and is therefore suitable for
hypodermic injection; but the drug is of inconsistent strength,
owing to the volatility of prussic acid.</p>

<p>The following varieties of the common laurel are in cultivation:
the Caucasian (<i>Prunus Laurocerasus</i>, var. <i>caucasica</i>), which is
hardier and bears very rich dark-green glossy foliage; the
Versailles laurel (var. <i>latifolia</i>), which has larger leaves; the
Colchican (var. <i>colchica</i>), which is a dwarf-spreading bush with
narrow sharply serrated pale-green leaves. There is also the
variety <i>rotundifolia</i> with short broad leaves, the Grecian with
narrow leaves and the Alexandrian with very small leaves.</p>

<p>The Portugal laurel is a native of Portugal and Madeira. It
was introduced into England about the year 1648, when it was
cultivated in the Oxford Botanic Gardens. During the first
half of the 18th century this plant, the common laurel and the
holly were almost the only hardy evergreen shrubs procurable in
British nurseries. They are all three tender about Paris, and
consequently much less seen in the neighbourhood of that city
than in England, where they stand the ordinary winters but not
very severe ones. There is a variety (<i>myrtifolia</i>) of compact habit
with smaller narrow leaves, also a variegated variety.</p>

<p>The evergreen glossy foliage of the common and Portugal
laurels render them well adapted for shrubberies, while the
racemes of white flowers are not devoid of beauty. The former
often ripens its insipid drupes, but the Portugal rarely does so.
It appears to be less able to accommodate itself to the English
climate, as the wood does not usually &ldquo;ripen&rdquo; so satisfactorily.
Hence it is rather more liable to be cut by the frost. It is grown
in the open air in the southern United States.</p>

<p>The bay or sweet laurel (<i>Laurus nobilis</i>) belongs to the family
Lauraceae, which contains sassafras, benzoin, camphor and other
trees remarkable for their aromatic properties. It is a large
evergreen shrub, sometimes reaching the height of 60 ft., but
rarely assuming a truly tree-like character. The leaves are
smaller than those of the preceding laurels, possessing an aromatic
and slightly bitter flavour, and are quite devoid of the poisonous
properties of the cherry laurel. The small yellowish-green
flowers are produced in axillary clusters, are male or female,
and consist of a simple 4-leaved perianth which encloses nine
stamens in the male, the anthers of which dehisce by valves
which lift upwards as in the common barberry, and carry
glandular processes at the base of the filament. The fruit consists
of a succulent berry surrounded by the persistent base of
the perianth. The bay laurel is a native of Italy, Greece and
North Africa, and is abundantly grown in the British Isles as
an evergreen shrub, as it stands most winters. The date of its
introduction is unknown, but must have been previous to 1562,
as it is mentioned in Turner&rsquo;s <i>Herbal</i> published in that year.
A full description also occurs in Gerard&rsquo;s <i>Herball</i> (1597, p. 1222).
It was used for strewing the floors of houses of distinguished
persons in the reign of Elizabeth. Several varieties have been
cultivated, differing in the character of their foliage, as the
<i>undulata</i> or wave-leafed, <i>salicifolia</i> or willow-leafed, the variegated,
the broad-leafed and the curled; there is also the double-flowered
variety. The bay laurel was carried to North America
by the early colonists.</p>

<p>This laurel is generally held to be the <i>Daphne</i> of the ancients,
though Lindley, following Gerard (<i>Herball</i>, 1597, p. 761), asserted
that the Greek <i>Daphne</i> was <i>Ruscus racemosus</i>. Among the
Greeks the laurel was sacred to Apollo, especially in connexion
with Tempe, in whose laurel groves the god himself obtained
purification from the blood of the Python. This legend was
dramatically represented at the Pythian festival once in eight
years, a boy fleeing from Delphi to Tempe, and after a time being
led back with song, crowned and adorned with laurel. Similar
<span class="grk" title="daphn√™phoriai">&#948;&#945;&#966;&#957;&#951;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span> were known elsewhere in Greece. Apollo, himself
purified, was the author of purification and atonement to other
penitents, and the laurel was the symbol of this power, which
came to be generally associated with his person and sanctuaries.
The relation of Apollo to the laurel was expressed in the legend
of Daphne (<i>q.v.</i>). The victors in the Pythian games were crowned
with the laurels of Apollo, and thus the laurel became the symbol
of triumph in Rome as well as in Greece. As Apollo was the god
of poets, the <i>Laurea Apollinaris</i> naturally belonged to poetic
merit (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Laureate</a></span>). The various prerogatives of the laurel
among the ancients are collected by Pliny (<i>Hist. Nat.</i> xv. 30).
It was a sign of truce, like the olive branch; letters announcing
victory and the arms of the victorious soldiery were garnished
with it; it was thought that lightning could not strike it, and the
emperor Tiberius always wore a laurel wreath during thunderstorms.
From its association with the divine power of purification
and protection, it was often set before the door of Greek
houses, and among the Romans it was the guardian of the gates
of the Caesars (Ovid, <i>Met.</i> i. 562 sq.). The laurel worn by
Augustus and his successors had a miraculous history: the laurel
grove at the imperial villa by the ninth milestone on the Flaminian
way sprang from a shoot sent from heaven to Livia Drusilla
(Sueton. <i>Galba</i>, i.). Like the olive, the laurel was forbidden to
profane use. It was employed in divination; the crackling of its
leaves in the sacred flame was a good omen (Tibull. ii. 5. 81),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>
and their silence unlucky (Propert. ii. 21); and the leaves when
chewed excited a prophetic afflatus (<span class="grk" title="daphn√™phagoi">&#948;&#945;&#966;&#957;&#951;&#966;&#940;&#947;&#959;&#953;</span>, cf. Tibull. ii.
5. 63). There is a poem enumerating the ancient virtues of the
laurel by J. Passeratius (1594).</p>

<p>The last of the plants mentioned above under the name of
laurel is the so-called spurge laurel (<i>Daphne Laureola</i>). This
and one other species (<i>D. Mezereum</i>), the mezereon, are the sole
representatives of the family Thymelaeaceae in Great Britain.
The spurge laurel is a small evergreen shrub, with alternate
somewhat lanceolate leaves with entire margins. The green
flowers are produced in early spring, and form drooping clusters
at the base of the leaves. The calyx is four-cleft, and carries
eight stamens in two circles of four each within the tube. The
pistil forms a berry, green at first, but finally black. The
mezereon differs in blossoming before the leaves are produced,
while the flowers are lilac instead of green. The bark furnishes
the drug <i>Cortex Mezerei</i>, for which that of the spurge laurel is
often substituted. Both are powerfully acrid, but the latter is
less so than the bark of mezereon. It is now only used as an
ingredient of the <i>liquor sarsae compositus concentratus</i>. Of other
species in cultivation there are <i>D. Fortunei</i> from China, which
has lilac flowers; <i>D. pontica</i>, a native of Asia Minor; <i>D. alpina</i>,
from the Italian Alps; <i>D. collina</i>, south European; and <i>D.
Cneorum</i>, the garland flower or trailing daphne, the handsomest
of the hardy species.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAURENS, HENRY<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> (1724-1792), American statesman, was
born in Charleston, South Carolina, on the 24th of February 1724,
of Huguenot ancestry. When sixteen he became a clerk in a
counting-house in London, and later engaged in commercial
pursuits with great success at Charleston until 1771, when he
retired from active business. He spent the next three years
travelling in Europe and superintending the education of his
sons in England. In spite of his strong attachment to England,
and although he had defended the Stamp Act, in 1774, in the hope
of averting war, he united with thirty-seven other Americans in
a petition to parliament against the passing of the Boston Port
Bill. Becoming convinced that a peaceful settlement was
impracticable, he returned to Charleston at the close of 1774,
and there allied himself with the conservative element of the
Whig party. He was soon made president of the South Carolina
council of safety, and in 1776 vice-president of the state; in
the same year he was sent as a delegate from South Carolina
to the general continental congress at Philadelphia, of which
body he was president from November 1777 until December
1778. In August 1780 he started on a mission to negotiate on
behalf of congress a loan of ten million dollars in Holland; but
he was captured on the 3rd of September off the Banks of
Newfoundland by the British frigate &ldquo;Vestal,&rdquo; taken to London
and closely imprisoned in the Tower. His papers were found to
contain a sketch of a treaty between the United States and
Holland projected by William Lee, in the service of Congress,
and Jan de Neufville, acting on behalf of Mynheer Van Berckel,
pensionary of Amsterdam, and this discovery eventually led to
war between Great Britain and the United Provinces. During
his imprisonment his health became greatly impaired. On
the 31st of December 1781 he was released on parole, and he was
finally exchanged for Cornwallis. In June 1782 he was appointed
one of the American commissioners for negotiating peace with
Great Britain, but he did not reach Paris until the 28th of
November 1782, only two days before the preliminaries of
peace were signed by himself, John Adams, Franklin and Jay.
On the day of signing, however, he procured the insertion of a
clause prohibiting the British from &ldquo;carrying away any negroes
or other property of American inhabitants&rdquo;; and this subsequently
led to considerable friction between the British and
American governments. On account of failing health he did
not remain for the signing of the definitive treaty, but
returned to Charleston, where he died on the 8th of December
1792.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">John Laurens</span> (1754-1782), American revolutionary
officer, was born at Charleston, South Carolina, on the 28th of
October 1754. He was educated in England, and on his return
to America in 1777, in the height of the revolutionary struggle,
he joined Washington&rsquo;s staff. He soon gained his commander&rsquo;s
confidence, which he reciprocated with the most devoted attachment,
and was entrusted with the delicate duties of a confidential
secretary, which he performed with much tact and skill. He
was present in all Washington&rsquo;s battles, from Brandywine to
Yorktown, and his gallantry on every occasion has gained him
the title of &ldquo;the Bayard of the Revolution.&rdquo; Laurens displayed
bravery even to rashness in the storming of the Chew mansion
at Germantown; at Monmouth, where he saved Washington&rsquo;s
life, and was himself severely wounded; and at Coosahatchie,
where, with a handful of men, he defended a pass against a
large English force under General Augustine Prevost, and was
again wounded. He fought a duel against General Charles Lee,
and wounded him, on account of that officer&rsquo;s disrespectful
conduct towards Washington. Laurens distinguished himself
further at Savannah, and at the siege of Charleston in 1780.
After the capture of Charleston by the English, he rejoined
Washington, and was selected by him as a special envoy to
appeal to the king of France for supplies for the relief of the
American armies, which had been brought by prolonged service
and scanty pay to the verge of dissolution. The more active
co-operation of the French fleets with the land forces in Virginia,
which was one result of his mission, brought about the disaster
of Cornwallis at Yorktown. Laurens lost no time in rejoining
the army, and at Yorktown was at the head of an American
storming party which captured an advanced redoubt. Laurens
was designated with the vicomte de Noailles to arrange the terms
of the surrender, which virtually ended the war, although
desultory skirmishing, especially in the South, attended the
months of delay before peace was formally concluded. In one
of these trifling affairs on the 27th of August 1782, on the
Combahee river, Laurens exposed himself needlessly and was
killed. Washington lamented deeply the death of Laurens,
saying of him, &ldquo;He had not a fault that I could discover, unless
it were intrepidity bordering upon rashness.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAURENT, FRAN√áOIS<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> (1810-1887), Belgian historian and
jurisconsult, was born at Luxemburg on the 8th of July 1810.
He held a high appointment in the ministry of justice for some
time before he became professor of civil law in the university
of Ghent in 1836. His advocacy of liberal and anti-clerical
principles both from his chair and in the press made him bitter
enemies, but he retained his position until his death on the 11th
of February 1887. He treated the relations of church and state
in <i>L&rsquo;√âglise et l&rsquo;√©tat</i> (Brussels, 3 vols., 1858-1862; new and
revised edition, 1865), and the same subject occupied a large
proportion of the eighteen volumes of his chief historical work,
<i>√âtudes sur l&rsquo;histoire de l&rsquo;humanit√©</i> (Ghent and Brussels, 1855-1870),
which aroused considerable interest beyond the boundaries
of Belgium. His fame as a lawyer rests on his authoritative
exposition of the Code Napol√©on in his <i>Principes de droit civil</i>
(Brussels, 33 vols., 1869-1878), and his <i>Droit civil international</i>
(Brussels, 8 vols., 1880-1881). He was charged in 1879 by the
minister of justice with the preparation of a report on the
proposed revision of the civil code. Besides his anti-clerical
pamphlets his minor writings include much discussion of social
questions, of the organization of savings banks, asylums, &amp;c.,
and he founded the <i>Soci√©t√© Callier</i> for the encouragement of
thrift among the working classes. With Gustave Callier, whose
funeral in 1863 was made the occasion of a display of clerical
intolerance, Laurent had much in common, and the efforts
of the society were directed to the continuation of Callier&rsquo;s
philanthropic schemes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAURENTINA, VIA,<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> an ancient road of Italy, leading southwards
from Rome. The question of the nomenclature of the
group of roads between the Via Ardeatina and the Via Ostiensis is
somewhat difficult, and much depends on the view taken as to
the site of Laurentum. It seems probable, however, that the
Via Laurentina proper is that which led out of the Porta Ardeatina
of the Aurelian wall and went direct to Tor Paterno, while
the road branching from the Via Ostiensis at the third mile, and
leading past Decimo to Lavinium (Pratica), which crosses the
other road at right angles not far from its destination (the
Laurentina there running S.W. and that to Lavinium S.E.)
may for convenience be called Lavinatis, though this name
does not occur in ancient times. On this latter road, beyond
Decimo, two milestones, one of Tiberius, the other of Maxentius,
each bearing the number 11, have been found; and farther on,
at Capocotta, traces of ancient buildings, and an important
sepulchral inscription of a Jewish ruler of a synagogue have
come to light. That the Via Laurentina was near the Via
Ardeatina is clear from the fact that the same contractor was
responsible for both roads. Laurentum was also accessible by
a branch from the Via Ostiensis at the eighth mile (at Malafede)
leading past Castel Porziano, the royal hunting-lodge, which is
identical with the ancient Ager Solonius (in which, Festus tells
us, was situated the Pomonal or sacred grove of Pomona) and
which later belonged to Marius.</p>

Zwickau he entered (1573) the university of Leipzig, graduating

<p><span class="bold">LAURIA<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Luria</span> or <span class="sc">Loria</span>) <span class="bold">ROGER DE</span> (d. 1305), admiral
of Aragon and Sicily, was the most prominent figure in the
naval war which arose directly from the Sicilian Vespers.
Nothing is really known of his life before he was named admiral
in 1283. His father was a supporter of the Hohenstaufen, and
his mother came to Spain with Costanza, the daughter of Manfred
of Beneventum, when she married Peter, the eldest son and
heir of James the Conqueror of Aragon. According to one
account Bella of Lauria, the admiral&rsquo;s mother, had been the
foster mother of Costanza. Roger, who accompanied his mother,
was bred at the court of Aragon and endowed with lands in
the newly conquered kingdom of Valencia. When the misrule
of Charles of Anjou&rsquo;s French followers had produced the famous
revolt known as the Sicilian Vespers in 1282, Roger de Lauria
accompanied King Peter III. of Aragon on the expedition which
under the cover of an attack on the Moorish kingdom of Tunis
was designed to be an attempt to obtain possession of all or
at least part of the Hohenstaufen dominions in Naples and
Sicily which the king claimed by right of his wife as the heiress
of Manfred. In 1283, when the island had put itself under the
protection of Peter III. and had crowned him king, he gave the
command of his fleet to Roger de Lauria. The commission speaks
of him in the most laudatory terms, but makes no reference to
previous military services.</p>

<p>From this time forward till the peace of Calatabellota in
1303, Roger de Lauria was the ever victorious leader of fleets
in the service of Aragon, both in the waters of southern Italy
and on the coast of Catalonia. In the year of his appointment
he defeated a French naval force in the service of Charles of
Anjou, off Malta. The main object before him was to repel
the efforts of the Angevine party to reconquer Sicily and then
to carry the war into their dominions in Naples. Although
Roger de Lauria did incidental fighting on shore, he was as
much a naval officer as any modern admiral, and his victories
were won by good man&oelig;uvring and by discipline. The Catalan
squadron, on which the Sicilian was moulded, was in a state
of high and intelligent efficiency. Its chiefs relied not on merely
boarding, and the use of the sword, as the French forces of
Charles of Anjou did, but on the use of the ram, and of the
powerful cross-bows used by the Catalans either by hand or, in
case of the larger ones, mounted on the bulwarks, with great
skill. The conflict was in fact the equivalent on the water of
the battles between the English bowmen and the disorderly
chivalry of France in the Hundred Years&rsquo; War. In 1284 Roger
defeated the Angevine fleet in the Bay of Naples, taking prisoner
the heir to the kingdom, Charles of Salerno, who remained a
prisoner in the hands of the Aragonese in Sicily, and later in
Spain, for years. In 1285 he fought on the coast of Catalonia
one of the most brilliant campaigns in all naval history. The
French king Philippe le Hardi had invaded Catalonia with
a large army to which the pope gave the character of crusaders,
in order to support his cousin of Anjou in his conflict with the
Aragonese. The king, Peter III., had offended his nobles by
his vigorous exercise of the royal authority, and received little
support from them, but the outrages perpetrated by the French
invaders raised the towns and country against them. The invaders
advanced slowly, taking the obstinately defended towns
one by one, and relying on the co-operation of a large number
of allies, who were stationed in squadrons along the coast, and
who brought stores and provisions from Narbonne and Aigues
Mortes. They relied in fact wholly on their fleet for their
existence. A successful blow struck at that would force them
to retreat. King Peter was compelled to risk Sicily for a time,
and he recalled Roger de Lauria from Palermo to the coast of
Catalonia. The admiral reached Barcelona on the 24th of August,
and was informed of the disposition of the French. He saw that
if he could break the centre of their line of squadrons, stretched
as it was so far that its general superiority of numbers was lost
in the attempt to occupy the whole of the coast, he could then
dispose of the extremities in detail. On the night of the 9th of
September he fell on the central squadron of the French fleet
near the Hormigas. The Catalan and Sicilian squadrons doubled
on the end of the enemies&rsquo; line, and by a vigorous employment
of the ram, as well as by the destructive shower of bolts from
the cross-bows, which cleared the decks of the French, gained
a complete victory. The defeat of the enemy was followed, as
usually in medieval naval wars, by a wholesale massacre. Roger
then made for Rosas, and tempted out the French squadron
stationed there by approaching under French colours. In the
open it was beaten in its turn. The result was the capture of
the town, and of the stores collected there by King Philippe for
the support of his army. Within a short time he was forced to
retreat amid sufferings from hunger, and the incessant attacks
of the Catalan mountaineers, by which his army was nearly
annihilated. This campaign, which was followed up by destructive
attacks on the French coast, saved Catalonia from the
invaders, and completely ruined the French naval power for
the time being. No medieval admiral of any nation displayed
an equal combination of intellect and energy, and none of
modern times has surpassed it. The work had been so effectually
done on the coast of Catalonia that Roger de Lauria was able
to return to Sicily, and resume his command in the struggle of
Aragonese and Angevine to gain, or to hold, the possession of
Naples.</p>

<p>He maintained his reputation and was uniformly successful
in his battles at sea, but they were not always fought for the
defence of Sicily. The death of Peter III. in 1286 and of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
eldest son Alphonso in the following year caused a division among
the members of the house of Aragon. The new king, James,
would have given up Sicily to the Angevine line with which
he made peace and alliance, but his younger brother Fadrique
accepted the crown offered him by the Sicilians, and fought
for his own hand against both the Angevines and his senior.
King James tried to force him to submission without success.
Roger de Lauria adhered for a time to Fadrique, but his arrogant
temper made him an intolerable supporter, and he appears,
moreover, to have thought that he was bound to obey the king
of Aragon. His large estates in Valencia gave him a strong
reason for not offending that sovereign. He therefore left
Fadrique, who confiscated his estates in Sicily and put one of
his nephews to death as a traitor. For this Roger de Lauria
took a ferocious revenge in two successive victories at sea over
the Sicilians. When the war, which had become a ravening of
wild beasts, was at last ended by the peace of Calatabellota,
Roger de Lauria retired to Valencia, where he died on the 2nd
of January 1305, and was buried, by his express orders, in the
church of Santas Creus, a now deserted monastery of the Cistercians,
at the feet of his old master Peter III. In his ferocity,
and his combination of loyalty to his feudal lord with utter
want of scruple to all other men, Roger belonged to his age.
As a captain he was far above his contemporaries and his
successors for many generations.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAURIA,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Loria</span>, a city of Basilicata, Italy, in the province
of Potenza, situated near the borders of Calabria, 7¬Ω m. by road
S. of Lagonegro. Pop. (1901) 10,470. It is a walled town on
the steep side of a hill with another portion in the plain below,

<p><span class="bold">LAURIER, SIR WILFRID<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> (1841-&emsp;&emsp;), Canadian statesman,
was born on the 20th of November 1841, at St Lin in the province
of Quebec. The child of French Roman Catholic parents, he
attended the elementary school of his native parish and for eight
or nine months was a pupil of the Protestant elementary school
at New Glasgow in order to learn English; his association with
the Presbyterian family with whom he lived during this period
had a permanent influence on his mind. At twelve years of age
he entered L&rsquo;Assomption college, and was there for seven years.
The college, like all the secondary schools in Quebec then available
for Roman Catholics, was under direct ecclesiastical control.
On leaving it he entered a law office at Montreal and took the
law course at McGill University. At graduation he delivered
the valedictory address for his class. This, like so many of his
later utterances, closed with an appeal for sympathy and union
between the French and English races as the secret of the future
of Canada. He began to practise law in Montreal, but owing to
ill-health soon removed to Athabaska, where he opened a law
office and undertook also to edit <i>Le D√©fricheur</i>, a newspaper then
on the eve of collapse. At Athabaska, the seat of one of the
superior courts of Quebec, the population of the district was fairly
divided between French- and English-speaking people, and
Laurier&rsquo;s career was undoubtedly influenced by his constant
association with English-speaking people and his intimate
acquaintance with their views and aspirations.</p>

<p>While at Montreal he had joined the Institut Canadien, a
literary and scientific society which, owing to its liberal discussions
and the fact that certain books upon its shelves were
on the <i>Index expurgatorius</i>, was finally condemned by the Roman
Catholic authorities. <i>Le D√©fricheur</i> was an organ of extreme
French sentiment, opposed to confederation, and also under
ecclesiastical censure. One of its few surviving copies contains
an article by Laurier opposing confederation as a scheme
designed in the interest of the English colonies in North America,
and certain to prove the tomb of the French race and the ruin
of Lower Canada. The Liberals of Quebec under the leadership
of Sir Antoine Dorion were hostile to confederation, or at least to
the terms of union agreed upon at the Quebec conference, and
Laurier in editorials and speeches maintained the position of
Dorion and his allies. He was elected to the Quebec legislature
in 1871, and his first speech in the provincial assembly excited
great interest, on account of its literary qualities and the attractive
manner and logical method of the speaker. He was not less
successful in the Dominion House of Commons, to which he was
elected in 1874. During his first two years in the federal parliament
his chief speeches were made in defence of Riel and the
French halfbreeds who were concerned in the Red River rebellion,
and on fiscal questions. Sir John Macdonald, then in opposition,
had committed his party to a protectionist policy, and Laurier,
notwithstanding that the Liberal party stood for a low tariff,
avowed himself to be &ldquo;a moderate protectionist.&rdquo; He declared
that if he were in Great Britain he would be a free trader, but
that free trade or protection must be applied according to the
necessities of a country, and that which protection necessarily
involved taxation it was the price a young and vigorous nation
must pay for its development. But the Liberal government, to
which Laurier was admitted as minister of inland revenue in
1877, made only a slight increase in duties, raising the general
tariff from 15% to 17¬Ω%; and against the political judgment
of Alexander Mackenzie, Sir Richard Cartwright, George Brown,
Laurier and other of the more influential leaders of the party,
it adhered to a low tariff platform. In the bye-election which
followed Laurier&rsquo;s admission to the cabinet he was defeated&mdash;the
only personal defeat he ever sustained; but a few weeks
later he was returned for Quebec East, a constituency which he
held thenceforth by enormous majorities. In 1878 his party went
out of office and Sir John Macdonald entered upon a long term
of power, with protection as the chief feature of his policy, to
which was afterwards added the construction of the Canadian
Pacific railway.</p>

<p>After the defeat of the Mackenzie government, Laurier sat
in Parliament as the leader of the Quebec Liberals and first
lieutenant to the Hon. Edward Blake, who succeeded Mackenzie
in the leadership of the party. He was associated with Blake in
his sustained opposition to high tariff, and to the Conservative
plan for the construction of the Canadian Pacific railway, and
was a conspicuous figure in the long struggle between Sir John
Macdonald and the leaders of the Liberal party to settle the
territorial limits of the province of Ontario and the legislative
rights of the provinces under the constitution. He was forced
also to maintain a long conflict with the ultramontane element
of the Roman Catholic church in Quebec, which for many years
had a close working alliance with the Conservative politicians
of the province and even employed spiritual coercion in order
to detach votes from the Liberal party. Notwithstanding that
Quebec was almost solidly Roman Catholic the Rouges sternly
resisted clerical pressure; they appealed to the courts and had
certain elections voided on the ground of undue clerical influence,
and at length persuaded the pope to send out a delegate to
Canada, through whose inquiry into the circumstances the abuses
were checked and the zeal of the ultramontanes restrained.</p>

<p>In 1887, upon the resignation of Blake on the ground of ill-health,
Laurier became leader of the Liberal party, although he
and many of the more influential men in the party doubted
the wisdom of the proceeding. He was the first French Canadian
to lead a federal party in Canada since confederation. Apart
from the natural fear that he would arouse prejudice in the
English-speaking provinces, the second Riel rebellion was then
still fresh in the public mind, and the fierce nationalist agitation
which Riel&rsquo;s execution had excited in Quebec had hardly subsided.
Laurier could hardly have come to the leadership at a
more inopportune moment, and probably he would not have
accepted the office at all if he had not believed that Blake could
be persuaded to resume the leadership when his health was
restored. But from the first he won great popularity even in the
English-speaking provinces, and showed unusual capacity for
leadership. His party was beaten in the first general election
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span>
held after he became leader (1891), but even with its policy of
unrestricted reciprocity with the United States, and with Sir
John Macdonald still at the head of the Conservative party, it
was beaten by only a small majority. Five years later, with
unrestricted reciprocity relegated to the background, and with
a platform which demanded tariff revision so adjusted as not to
endanger established interests, and which opposed the federal
measure designed to restore in Manitoba the separate or Roman
Catholic schools which the provincial government had abolished,
Laurier carried the country, and in July 1896 he was called by
Lord Aberdeen, then governor-general, to form a government.</p>

<p>He was the first French-Canadian to occupy the office of
premier; and his personal supremacy was shown by his long
continuance in power. During the years from 1896 to 1910, he
came to hold a position within the British Empire which was
in its way unique, and in this period he had seen Canadian
prosperity advance progressively by leaps and bounds. The
chief features of his administration were the fiscal preference of
33<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>% in favour of goods imported into Canada from Great
Britain, the despatch of Canadian contingents to South Africa
during the Boer war, the contract with the Grand Trunk railway
for the construction of a second transcontinental road from
ocean to ocean, the assumption by Canada of the imperial
fortresses at Halifax and Esquimault, the appointment of a
federal railway commission with power to regulate freight charges,
express rates and telephone rates, and the relations between
competing companies, the reduction of the postal rate to Great
Britain from 5 cents to 2 cents and of the domestic rate from
3 cents to 2 cents, a substantial contribution to the Pacific cable,
a practical and courageous policy of settlement and development
in the Western territories, the division of the North-West
territories into the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan and
the enactment of the legislation necessary to give them provincial
status, and finally (1910), a tariff arrangement with the United
States, which, if not all that Canada might claim in the way of
reciprocity, showed how entirely the course of events had changed
the balance of commercial interests in North America.</p>

<p>Laurier made his first visit to Great Britain on the occasion
of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s diamond jubilee (1897), when he received
the grand cross of the Bath; he then secured the denunciation of
the Belgian and German treaties and thus obtained for the
colonies the right to make preferential trade arrangements with
the mother country. His personality made a powerful impression
in Great Britain and also in France, which he visited before his
return to Canada. His strong facial resemblance both to Lord
Beaconsfield and to Sir John Macdonald marked him out in the
public eye, and he captured attention by his charm of manner,
fine command of scholarly English and genuine eloquence.
Some of his speeches in Great Britain, coming as they did from
a French-Canadian, and revealing delicate appreciation of
British sentiment and thorough comprehension of the genius of
British institutions, excited great interest and enthusiasm,
while one or two impassioned speeches in the Canadian parliament
during the Boer war profoundly influenced opinion in
Canada and had a pronounced effect throughout the empire.</p>

<p>A skilful party-leader, Laurier kept from the first not only
the affection of his political friends but the respect of his
opponents; while enforcing the orderly conduct of public
business, he was careful as first minister to maintain the dignity
of parliament. In office he proved more of an opportunist than
his career in opposition would have indicated, but his political
courage and personal integrity remained beyond suspicion.
His jealousy for the political autonomy of Canada was noticeable
in his attitude at the Colonial conference held at the time of
King Edward&rsquo;s coronation, and marked all his diplomatic dealings
with the mother country. But he strove for sympathetic relations
between Canadian and imperial authorities, and favoured
general legislative and fiscal co-operation between the two
countries. He strove also for good relations between the two
races in Canada, and between Canada and the United States.
Although he was classed in Canada as a Liberal, his tendencies
would in England have been considered strongly conservative;
an individualist rather than a collectivist, he opposed the
intrusion of the state into the sphere of private enterprise, and
showed no sympathy with the movement for state operation
of railways, telegraphs and telephones, or with any kindred
proposal looking to the extension of the obligations of the
central government.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAURISTON, JACQUES ALEXANDRE BERNARD LAW,<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span>
<span class="sc">Marquis de</span> (1768-1828), French soldier and diplomatist, was
the son of Jacques Fran√ßois Law de Lauriston (1724-1785), a
general officer in the French army, and was born at Pondicherry
on the 1st of February 1768. He obtained his first commission
about 1786, served with the artillery and on the staff in the
earlier Revolutionary campaigns, and became brigadier of
artillery in 1795. Resigning in 1796, he was brought back into
the service in 1800 as aide-de-camp to Napoleon, with whom
as a cadet Lauriston had been on friendly terms. In the years
immediately preceding the first empire Lauriston was successively
director of the Le F√®re artillery school and special envoy
to Denmark, and he was selected to convey to England the ratification
of the peace of Amiens (1802). In 1805, having risen to
the rank of general of division, he took part in the war against
Austria. He occupied Venice and Ragusa in 1806, was made
governor-general of Venice in 1807, took part in the Erfurt
negotiations of 1808, was made a count, served with the emperor
in Spain in 1808-1809 and held commands under the viceroy
Eug√®ne Beauharnais in the Italian campaign and the advance
to Vienna in the same year. At the battle of Wagram he commanded
the guard artillery in the famous &ldquo;artillery preparation&rdquo;
which decided the battle. In 1811 he was made ambassador to
Russia; in 1812 he held a command in the <i>Grande Arm√©e</i> and
won distinction by his firmness in covering the retreat from
Moscow. He commanded the V. army corps at L√ºtzen and
Bautzen and the V. and XI. in the autumn campaign, falling
into the hands of the enemy in the disastrous retreat from
Leipzig. He was held a prisoner of war until the fall of the
empire, and then joined Louis XVIII., to whom he remained
faithful in the Hundred Days. His reward was a seat in the
house of peers and a command in the royal guard. In 1817 he
was created marquis and in 1823 marshal of France. During the
Spanish War he commanded the corps which besieged and took
Pamplona. He died at Paris on the 12th of June 1828.</p>

Attica, Greece, famous for the silver mines which were one of
the chief sources of revenue of the Athenian state, and were
employed for coinage. After the battle of Marathon, Themistocles
persuaded the Athenians to devote the revenue derived
from the mines to shipbuilding, and thus laid the foundation of
the Athenian naval power, and made possible the victory of
Salamis. The mines, which were the property of the state,
were usually farmed out for a certain fixed sum and a percentage
on the working; slave labour was exclusively employed. Towards
the end of the 5th century the output was diminished,
partly owing to the Spartan occupation of Decelea. But the
mines continued to be worked, though Strabo records that in
his time the tailings were being worked over, and Pausanias
speaks of the mines as a thing of the past. The ancient workings,
consisting of shafts and galleries for excavating the ore, and pans
and other arrangements for extracting the metal, may still be seen.
The mines are still worked at the present day by French and
Greek companies, but mainly for lead, manganese and cadmium.
The population of the modern town was 10,007 in 1907.</p>

village was formerly named Calumet, and was incorporated
under that name in 1889, but in 1895 its name was changed by

Laurium in Greece. The name Calumet is now applied to the

by the Skien railway. Pop. (1900) 10,664. It has various
industries, including saw and planing mills, shipbuilding, glassworks
and factories for wood-pulp, barrels and potato flour; and
an active trade in exporting timber, ice, wood-pulp and granite,
chiefly to Great Britain, and in importing from the same country
coal and salt. The port has a depth of 18 to 24 ft. beside the
quays. Four miles south is Fredriksvaern, formerly a station of

<p><span class="bold">LAUSANNE,<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> the capital of the Swiss canton of Vaud. It is
the junction of the railway lines from Geneva, from Brieg and
the Simplon, from Fribourg and Bern, and from Vallorbe (for
Paris). A funicular railway connects the upper town with the
central railway station and with Ouchy, the port of Lausanne
on the lake of Geneva. Lausanne takes its name from the Flon
stream flowing through it, which was formerly called Laus
(water). The older or upper portion of the town is built on the
crest and slopes of five hillocks and in the hollows between them,
all forming part of the Jorat range. It has a picturesque appearance
from the surface of the lake, above which the cathedral
rises some 500 ft., while from the town there is a fine view across
the lake towards the mountains of Savoy and of the Valais.
The quaint characteristics of the hilly site of the old town have
largely been destroyed by modern improvements, which began
in 1836 and were not quite completed in 1910. The Grand Pont,
designed by the cantonal engineer, Adrien Pichard (1790-1841),
was built 1839-1844, while the Barre tunnel was pierced 1851-1855
and the bridge of Chauderon was built in 1905. The
valleys and lower portions of the town were gradually filled up
so as to form a series of squares, of which those of Riponne and
of St Fran√ßois are the finest, the latter now being the real centre
of the town. The railways were built between 1856 and 1862,
while the opening of the Simplon tunnel (1906) greatly increased
the commercial importance of Lausanne, which is now on the
great international highway from Paris to Milan. From 1896
onwards a well-planned set of tramways within the town was
constructed. The town is still rapidly extending, especially
towards the south and west. Since the days of Gibbon (resident
here for three periods, 1753-1758, 1763-1764 and 1783-1793),
whose praises of the town have been often repeated, Lausanne
has become a favourite place of residence for foreigners (including
many English), who are especially attracted by the excellent
establishments for secondary and higher education. Hence in
1900 there were 9501 foreign residents (of whom 628 were British
subjects) out of a total population of 46,732 inhabitants; in
1905 it was reckoned that these numbers had risen respectively
to 10,625, 818 and 53,577. In 1709 it is said that the inhabitants
numbered but 7432 and 9965 in 1803, while the numbers were
20,515 in 1860 and 33,340 in 1888. Of the population in 1900
the great majority was French-speaking (only 6627 German-speaking
and 3146 Italian-speaking) and Protestant (9364
Romanists and 473 Jews).</p>

<p>The principal building is the cathedral church (now Protestant)
of Notre Dame, which with the castle occupies the highest
position. It is the finest medieval ecclesiastical building in
Switzerland. Earlier buildings were more or less completely
destroyed by fire, but the present edifice was consecrated in
1275 by Pope Gregory X. in the presence of the emperor Rudolf of
Habsburg. It was sacked after the Bernese conquest (1536) and
the introduction of Protestantism, but many ancient tapestries
and other precious objects are still preserved in the Historical
Museum at Bern. The church was well restored at great cost
from 1873 onwards, as it is the great pride of the citizens. Close
by is the castle, built in the early 15th century by the bishops,
later the residence of the Bernese bailiffs and now the seat of
the various branches of the administration of the canton of
Vaud. Near both is the splendid Palais de Rumine (on the Place
de la Riponne), opened in 1906 and now housing the university
as well as the cantonal library, the cantonal picture gallery
(or Mus√©e Arlaud, founded 1841) and the cantonal collections of
archaeology, natural history, &amp;c. The university was raised
to that rank in 1890, but, as an academy, dates from 1537.
Among its former teachers may be mentioned Theodore Beza,
Conrad Gesner, J. P. de Crousaz, Charles Monnard, Alexandre
Vinet, Eug√®ne Rambert, Juste Olivier and several members of
the Secretan family. On the Montbenon heights to the south-west
of the cathedral group is the federal palace of justice, the
seat (since 1886) of the federal court of justice, which, erected
by the federal constitution of 29th May 1874, was fixed at
Lausanne by a federal resolution of 26th June 1874. The house,
La Grotte, which Gibbon inhabited 1783-1793, and on the terrace
of which he completed (1787) his famous history, was demolished
in 1896 to make room for the new post office that stands on the
Place St Fran√ßois. The asylum for the blind was mainly founded
(1845) by the generosity of W. Haldimand, an Englishman of
Swiss descent. The first book printed in Lausanne was the missal
of the cathedral church (1493), while the <i>Gazette de Lausanne</i>
(founded 1798) took that name in 1804. Lausanne has been the
birthplace of many distinguished men, such as Benjamin Constant,
the Secretans, Vinet and Rambert. It is the seat of many
benevolent, scientific and literary societies and establishments.</p>

<p>The original town (mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary) was
on the shore of the lake, near Vidy, south-west of the present
city. It was burnt in the 4th century by the Alamanni. Some
of the inhabitants took refuge in the hills above and there
founded a new town, which acquired more importance when
Bishop Marius about 590 chose it as his see city (perhaps transferring
it from Avenches). Here rose the cathedral church, the
bishop&rsquo;s palace, &amp;c. Across the Flon was a Burgundian settlement,
later known as the Bourg, while to the west was a third
colony around the church of St Laurent. These three elements
joined together to form the present city. The bishops obtained
little by little great temporal powers (the diocese extended to the
left bank of the Aar) and riches, becoming in 1125 princes of the
empire, while their chapter was recruited only from the noblest
families. But in 1368 the bishop was forced to recognize various
liberties and customs that had been gradually won by the
citizens, the <i>Plaid G√©n√©ral</i> of that year showing that there was
already some kind of municipal government, save for the <i>cit√©</i>,
which was not united with the <i>ville inf√©rieure</i> or the other four
<i>quartiers</i> (Bourg, St Laurent, La Palud and Le Pont) in 1481.
In 1525 the city made an alliance with Bern and Fribourg. But
in 1536 the territory of the bishop (as well as the Savoyard
barony of Vaud) was forcibly conquered by the Bernese, who
at once introduced Protestantism. The Bernese occupation
lasted till 1798, though in 1723 an attempt was made to put an
end to it by Major Davel, who lost his life in consequence. In
1798 Lausanne became a simple prefecture of the canton L√©man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>
of the Helvetic republic. But in 1803, on the creation of the
canton of Vaud by the Act of Mediation, it became its capital.
The bishop of Lausanne resided after 1663 at Fribourg, while
from 1821 onwards he added &ldquo;and of Geneva&rdquo; to his title.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAUTREC, ODET DE FOIX,<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> <span class="sc">Vicomte de</span> (1488-1528),
French soldier. The branch of the viscounts of Lautrec originated
with Pierre, the grandson of Archambaud de Grailly,
captal de Buch, who came into possession of the county of Foix
in 1401. Odet de Foix and his two brothers, the seigneur de
Lescun and the seigneur de l&rsquo;Esparre or Asparros, served Francis
I. as captains; and the influence of their sister, Fran√ßoise de
Ch√¢teaubriant, who became the king&rsquo; mistress, gained them
high offices. In 1515 Lautrec took part in the campaign of
Marignano. In 1516 he received the government of the Milanese,
and by his severity made the French domination insupportable.
In 1521 he succeeded in defending the duchy against the Spanish
army, but in 1522 he was completely defeated at the battle of
the Bicocca, and was forced to evacuate the Milanese. The
mutiny of his Swiss troops had compelled him, against his wish,
to engage in the battle. Created marshal of France, he received
again, in 1527, the command of the army of Italy, occupied the
Milanese, and was then sent to undertake the conquest of the
kingdom of Naples. The defection of Andrea Doria and the
plague which broke out in the French camp brought on a fresh
disaster. Lautrec himself caught the infection, and died on
the 15th of August 1528. He had the reputation of a gallant
and able soldier, but this reputation scarcely seems to be justified
by the facts; though he was always badly used by fortune.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAUZUN, ANTONIN NOMPAR DE CAUMONT,<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> <span class="sc">Marquis
de Puyguilhem, Duc de</span> (1632-1723), French courtier and
soldier, was the son of Gabriel, comte de Lauzun, and his wife
Charlotte, daughter of the duc de La Force. He was brought
up with the children of his kinsman, the mar√©chal de Gramont,
of whom the comte de Guiche became the lover of Henrietta
of England, duchess of Orleans, while Catherine Charlotte,
afterwards princess of Monaco, was the object of the one
passion of Lauzun&rsquo;s life. He entered the army, and served under
Turenne, also his kinsman, and in 1655 succeeded his father as
commander of the <i>cent gentilshommes de la maison du roi</i>. Puyguilhem
(or P√©guilin, as contemporaries simplified his name)
rapidly rose in Louis XIV.&rsquo;s favour, became colonel of the royal
regiment of dragoons, and was gazetted <i>mar√©chal de camp</i>. He
and Mme de Monaco belonged to the coterie of the young
duchess of Orleans. His rough wit and skill in practical jokes
pleased Louis XIV., but his jealousy and violence were the
causes of his undoing. He prevented a meeting between Louis
XIV. and Mme de Monaco, and it was jealousy in this matter,
rather than hostility to Louise de la Valli√®re, which led him to
promote Mme de Montespan&rsquo;s intrigues with the king. He asked
this lady to secure for him the post of grand-master of the
artillery, and on Louis&rsquo;s refusal to give him the appointment
he turned his back on the king, broke his sword, and swore
that never again would he serve a monarch who had broken
his word. The result was a short sojourn in the Bastille, but he
soon returned to his functions of court buffoon. Meanwhile,
the duchess of Montpensier (La Grande Mademoiselle) had
fallen in love with the little man, whose ugliness seems to have
exercised a certain fascination over many women. He naturally
encouraged one of the greatest heiresses in Europe, and the
wedding was fixed for the 20th of December 1670, when on the
18th Louis sent for his cousin and forbade the marriage. Mme
de Montespan had never forgiven his fury when she failed to
procure the grand-mastership of the artillery, and now, with
Louvois, secured his arrest. He was removed in November
1671 from the Bastille to Pignerol, where excessive precautions
were taken to ensure his safety. He was eventually allowed
free intercourse with Fouquet, but before that time he managed
to find a way through the chimney into Fouquet&rsquo;s room, and
on another occasion succeeded in reaching the courtyard in
safety. Another fellow-prisoner, from communication with
whom he was supposed to be rigorously excluded, was Eustache
Dauger (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Iron Mask</a></span>).</p>

<p>It was now intimated to Mademoiselle that Lauzun&rsquo;s restoration
to liberty depended on her immediate settlement of the
principality of Dombes, the county of Eu and the duchy of
Aumale&mdash;three properties assigned by her to Lauzun&mdash;on the
little duc de Maine, eldest son of Louis XIV. and Mme de Montespan.
She gave way, but Lauzun, even after ten years of imprisonment,
refused to sign the documents, when he was brought
to Bourbon for the purpose. A short term of imprisonment
at Chalon-sur-S√¢one made him change his mind, but when he
was set free Louis XIV. was still set against the marriage, which
is supposed to have taken place secretly (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Montpensier</a></span>).
Married or not, Lauzun was openly courting Fouquet&rsquo;s daughter,
whom he had seen at Pignerol. He was to be restored to his
place at court, and to marry Mlle Fouquet, who, however,
became Mme d&rsquo;Uz√®s in 1683. In 1685 Lauzun went to England
to seek his fortune under James II., whom he had served as
duke of York in Flanders. He rapidly gained great influence
at the English court. In 1688 he was again in England, and
arranged the flight of Mary of Modena and the infant prince,
whom he accompanied to Calais, where he received strict instructions
from Louis to bring them &ldquo;on any pretext&rdquo; to
Vincennes. In the late autumn of 1689 he was put in command
of the expedition fitted out at Brest for service in Ireland, and
he sailed in the following year. Lauzun was honest, a quality
not too common in James II.&rsquo;s officials in Ireland, but had no
experience of the field, and he blindly followed Richard Talbot,
earl of Tyrconnel. After the battle of the Boyne they fled
to Limerick, and thence to the west, leaving Patrick Sarsfield
to show a brave front. In September they sailed for France,
and on their arrival at Versailles Lauzun found that his failure
had destroyed any prospect of a return of Louis XIV.&rsquo;s favour.
Mademoiselle died in 1693, and two years later Lauzun married
Genevi√®ve de Durfort, a child of fourteen, daughter of the
mar√©chal de Lorges. Mary of Modena, through whose interest
Lauzun secured his dukedom, retained her faith in him, and
it was he who in 1715, more than a quarter of a century after
the flight from Whitehall, brought her the news of the disaster
of Sheriffmuir. Lauzun died on the 19th of November 1723.
The duchy fell to his nephew, Armand de Gontaut, comte de
Biron.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAVA,<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> an Italian word (from Lat. <i>lavare</i>, to wash) applied
to the liquid products of volcanic activity. Streams of rain-water,
formed by condensation of exhaled steam often mingled
with volcanic ashes so as to produce mud, are known as <i>lava
d&rsquo;acqua</i>, whilst the streams of molten matter are called <i>lava di
fuoco</i>. The term lava is applied by geologists to all matter of
volcanic origin, which is, or has been, in a molten state. The
magma, or molten lava in the interior of the earth, may be
regarded as a mutual solution of various mineral silicates, charged
with highly-heated vapour, sometimes to the extent of super-saturation.
According to the proportion of silica, the lava
is distinguished as &ldquo;acid&rdquo; or &ldquo;basic.&rdquo; The basic lavas are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span>
usually darker and denser than lavas of acid type, and when
fused they tend to flow to great distances, and may thus form
far-spreading sheets, whilst the acid lavas, being more viscous,
rapidly consolidate after extrusion. The lava is emitted from
the volcanic vent at a high temperature, but on exposure to the
air it rapidly consolidates superficially, forming a crust which
in many cases is soon broken up by the continued flow of the
subjacent liquid lava, so that the surface becomes rugged with
clinkers. J. D. Dana introduced the term &ldquo;aa&rdquo; for this rough
kind of lava-stream, whilst he applied the term &ldquo;pahoehoe&rdquo;
to those flows which have a smooth surface, or are simply wrinkled
and ropy; these terms being used in this sense in Hawaii, in
relation to the local lavas. The different kinds of lava are more
fully described in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Volcano</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAVABO<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> (Lat. &ldquo;I will wash&rdquo;; the Fr. equivalent is lavoir),
in ecclesiastical usage, the term for the washing of the priests&rsquo;
hands, at the celebration of the Mass, at the offertory. The
words of Psalm xxvi. 6, <i>Lavabo inter innocentes manus meas</i>,
are said during the rite. The word is also used for the basin
employed in the ritual washing, and also for the lavatories,
generally erected in the cloisters of monasteries. Those at
Gloucester, Norwich and Lincoln are best known. A very
curious example at Fontenay, surrounding a pillar, is given by
Viollet-le-Duc. In general the lavabo is a sort of trough; in
some places it has an almery for towels, &amp;c.</p>

It has a small shipbuilding trade, and exports great quantities
of slate (<i>lavagna</i>, taking its name from the town). It also has
a large cotton-mill. It was the seat of the Fieschi family,
independent counts, who, at the end of the 12th century, were
obliged to recognize the supremacy of Genoa. Sinibaldo Fieschi
became Pope Innocent IV. (1243-1254), and Hadrian V. (1276)
was also a Fieschi.</p>

French soldier. In 1423 he served in the French army against
England, and in 1428 was taken prisoner by John Talbot, 1st
earl of Shrewsbury, after the capitulation of Laval, which he
was defending. After paying his ransom he was present with
Joan of Arc at the siege of Orleans, at the battle of Patay, and
at the coronation of Charles VII. He was made admiral of
France in 1437 and marshal in 1439. He served Charles VII.
faithfully in all his wars, even against the dauphin (1456),
and when the latter became king as Louis XI., Laval was
dismissed from the marshal&rsquo;s office. After the War of the Public
Weal he was restored to favour, and recovered the marshal&rsquo;s
b√¢ton, the king also granting him the offices of lieutenant-general
to the government of Paris and governor of Picardy, and conferring
upon him the collar of the order of St Michael. In 1472
Laval was successful in resisting the attacks of Charles the Bold,
duke of Burgundy, on Beauvais.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAVAL,<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> a town of north-western France, capital of the
department of Mayenne, on the Mayenne river, 188 m. W.S.W.
of Paris by rail. Pop. (1906) 24,874. On the right bank of
the river stands the old feudal city, with its ancient castle and
its irregularly built houses whose slate roofs and pointed gables
peep from the groves of trees which clothe the hill. On the left
bank the regularly built new town extends far into the plain.
The river, here 80 yds. broad, is crossed by the handsome
railway viaduct, a beautiful stone bridge called Pont Neuf, and
the Pont Vieux with three pointed arches, built in the 16th
century. There is communication by steamer as far as Angers.
Laval may justly claim to be one of the loveliest of French towns.
Its most curious and interesting monument is the sombre old
castle of the counts (now a prison) with a donjon of the 12th
century, the roof of which presents a fine example of the timberwork
superseded afterwards by stone machicolation. The &ldquo;new
castle,&rdquo; dating partly from the Renaissance, serves as court-house.
Laval possesses several churches of different periods: in that
of the Trinity, which serves as the cathedral, the transept and
nave are of the 12th century while the choir is of the 16th;
St V√©n√©rand (15th century) has good stained glass; Notre-Dame
des Cordeliers, which dates from the end of the 14th century
or the beginning of the 15th, has some fine marble altars.
Half-a-mile below the Pont Vieux is the beautiful 12th-century
church of Aveni√®res, with an ornamental spire
of 1534. The finest remaining relic of the ancient fortifications
is the Beucheresse gate near the cathedral. The narrow
streets around the castle are bordered by many old houses of
the 15th and 16th century, chief among which is that known
as the &ldquo;Maison du Grand Veneur.&rdquo; There are an art-museum,
a museum of natural history and archaeology and a library.
The town is embellished by fine promenades, at the entrance
of one of which, facing the mairie, stands the statue of the
celebrated surgeon Ambroise Par√© (1517-1590). Laval is the
seat of a prefect, a bishopric created in 1855, and a court of
assizes, and has tribunals of first instance and of commerce,
a chamber of commerce, a board of trade-arbitrators, training
colleges, an ecclesiastical seminary and a lyc√©e for boys. The
principal industry of the town is the cloth manufacture, introduced
from Flanders in the 14th century. The production of
fabrics of linen, of cotton or of mixtures of both, occupies some
10,000 hands in the town and suburbs. Among the numerous
other industries are metal-founding, flour-milling, tanning,
dyeing, the making of boots and shoes, and the sawing of the
marble quarried in the vicinity. There is trade in grain.</p>

<p>Laval is not known to have existed before the 9th century.
It was taken by John Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, in 1428,
changed hands several times during the wars of the League, and
played an important part at the end of the 18th century in the
war of La Vend√©e.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Seigneurs and Counts of Laval.</span> The castle of Laval was
founded at the beginning of the 11th century by a lord of the
name of Guy, and remained in the possession of his male descendants
until the 13th century. In 1218 the lordship passed to the
house of Montmorency by the marriage of Emma, daughter
of Guy VI. of Laval, to Mathieu de Montmorency, the hero
of the battle of Bouvines. Of this union was born Guy VII.
seigneur of Laval, the ancestor of the second house of Laval.
Anne of Laval (d. 1466), the heiress of the second family, married
John de Montfort, who took the name of Guy (XIII.) of Laval.
At Charles VII.&rsquo;s coronation (1429) Guy XIV., who was afterwards
son-in-law of John V., duke of Brittany, and father-in-law
of King Ren√© of Anjou, was created count of Laval, and the
countship remained in the possession of Guy&rsquo;s male descendants
until 1547. After the Montforts, the countship of Laval passed
by inheritance to the families of Rieux and Sainte Maure, to
the Colignys, and finally to the La Tr√©moilles, who held it until
the Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA VALLI√àRE, LOUISE FRAN√áOISE DE<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> (1644-1710),
mistress of Louis XIV., was born at Tours on the 6th of August
1644, the daughter of an officer, Laurent de la Baume le Blanc,
who took the name of La Valli√®re from a small property near
Amboise. Laurent de la Valli√®re died in 1651; his widow,
who soon married again, joined the court of Gaston d&rsquo;Orl√©ans
at Blois. Louise was brought up with the younger princesses,
the step-sisters of La Grande Mademoiselle. After Gaston&rsquo;s
death his widow moved with her daughters to the palace of the
Luxembourg in Paris, and with them went Louise, who was now
a girl of sixteen. Through the influence of a distant kinswoman,
Mme de Choisy, she was named maid of honour to Henrietta
of England, who was about her own age and had just married
Philip of Orleans, the king&rsquo;s brother. Henrietta joined the court
at Fontainebleau, and was soon on the friendliest terms with her
brother-in-law, so friendly indeed that there was some scandal,
to avoid which it was determined that Louis should pay marked
attentions elsewhere. The person selected was Madame&rsquo;s maid
of honour, Louise. She had been only two months in Fontainebleau
before she became the king&rsquo;s mistress. The affair, begun
on Louis&rsquo;s part as a blind, immediately developed into real
passion on both sides. It was Louis&rsquo;s first serious attachment,
and Louise was an innocent, religious-minded girl, who brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
neither coquetry nor self-interest to their relation, which was
sedulously concealed. Nicolas Fouquet&rsquo;s curiosity in the matter
was one of the causes of his disgrace. In February 1662 there
was a storm when Louise refused to tell her lover the relations
between Madame (Henrietta) and the comte de Guiche. She
fled to an obscure convent at Chaillot, where Louis rapidly
followed her. Her enemies, chief of whom was Olympe Mancini,
comtesse de Soissons, Mazarin&rsquo;s niece, sought her downfall by
bringing her liaison to the ears of Queen Maria Theresa. She
was presently removed from the service of Madame, and established
in a small building in the Palais Royal, where in December
1663 she gave birth to a son Charles, who was given in charge
to two faithful servants of Colbert. Concealment was practically
abandoned after her return to court, and within a week of Anne
of Austria&rsquo;s death in January 1666, La Valli√®re appeared at
mass side by side with Maria Theresa. But her favour was
already waning. She had given birth to a second child in
January 1665, but both children were dead before the autumn
of 1666. A daughter born at Vincennes in October 1666, who
received the name of Marie Anne and was known as Mlle de
Blois, was publicly recognized by Louis as his daughter in
letters-patent making the mother a duchess in May 1667 and
conferring on her the estate of Vaujours. In October of that
year she bore a son, but by this time her place in Louis&rsquo;s affections
was definitely usurped by Ath√©na√Øs de Montespan (<i>q.v.</i>), who had
long been plotting against her. She was compelled to remain at
court as the king&rsquo;s official mistress, and even to share Mme de
Montespan&rsquo;s apartments at the Tuileries. She made an attempt
at escape in 1671, when she fled to the convent of Ste Marie de
Chaillot, only to be compelled to return. In 1674 she was finally
permitted to enter the Carmelite convent in the Rue d&rsquo;Enfer.
She took the final vows a year later, when Bossuet pronounced
the allocution.</p>

<p>Her daughter married Armand de Bourbon, prince of Conti,
in 1680. The count of Vermandois, her youngest born, died
on his first campaign at Courtrai in 1683.</p>

1741. He was educated at the gymnasium of his native town,
where J. J. Bodmer and J. J. Breitinger were among his teachers.
When barely one-and-twenty he greatly distinguished himself
by denouncing, in conjunction with his friend, the painter
H. Fuseli, an iniquitous magistrate, who was compelled to make
restitution of his ill-gotten gains. In 1769 Lavater took orders,
and officiated till his death as deacon or pastor in various churches
in his native city. His oratorical fervour and genuine depth
of conviction gave him great personal influence; he was extensively
consulted as a casuist, and was welcomed with demonstrative
enthusiasm in his numerous journeys through Germany.
His mystical writings were also widely popular. Scarcely a trace
of this influence has remained, and Lavater&rsquo;s name would be
forgotten but for his work on physiognomy, <i>Physiognomische
Fragmente zur Bef√∂rderung der Menschenkenntnis und Menschenliebe</i>
(1775-1778). The fame even of this book, which found
enthusiastic admirers in France and England, as well as in Germany,
rests to a great extent upon the handsome style of publication
and the accompanying illustrations. It left, however, the
study of physiognomy (<i>q.v.</i>), as desultory and unscientific as it
found it. As a poet, Lavater published <i>Christliche Lieder</i> (1776-1780)
and two epics, <i>Jesus Messias</i> (1780) and <i>Joseph von
Arimathia</i> (1794), in the style of Klopstock. More important
and characteristic of the religious temperament of Lavater&rsquo;s
age are his introspective <i>Aussichten in die Ewigkeit</i> (4 vols.,
1768-1778); <i>Geheimes Tagebuch von einem Beobachter seiner
selbst</i> (2 vols., 1772-1773) and <i>Pontius Pilatus, oder der Mensch
in allen Gestalten</i> (4 vols., 1782-1785). From 1774 on, Goethe
was intimately acquainted with Lavater, but at a later period
he became estranged from him, somewhat abruptly accusing
him of superstition and hypocrisy. Lavater had a mystic&rsquo;s
indifference to historical Christianity, and, although esteemed
by himself and others a champion of orthodoxy, was in fact only
an antagonist of rationalism. During the later years of his life
his influence waned, and he incurred ridicule by some exhibitions
of vanity. He redeemed himself by his patriotic conduct during
the French occupation of Switzerland, which brought about his
tragical death. On the taking of Z√ºrich by the French in 1799,
Lavater, while endeavouring to appease the soldiery, was shot
through the body by an infuriated grenadier; he died after long
sufferings borne with great fortitude, on the 2nd of January 1801.</p>

<p>Lavater himself published two collections of his writings,

<p><span class="bold">LAVAUR,<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> a town of south-western France, capital of an
arrondissement in the department of Tarn, 37 m. S.E. of Montauban
by rail. Pop. (1906), town 4069; commune 6388.
Lavaur stands on the left bank of the Agout, which is here
crossed by a railway-bridge and a fine stone bridge of the
late 18th century. From 1317 till the Revolution Lavaur was
the seat of a bishopric, and there is a cathedral dating from the
13th, 14th and 15th centuries, with an octagonal bell-tower;
a second smaller square tower contains a <i>jaquemart</i> (a statue
which strikes the hours with a hammer) of the 16th century.
In the bishop&rsquo;s garden is the statue of Emmanuel Augustin,
marquis de Las Cases, one of the companions of Napoleon at
St Helena. The town carries on distilling and flour-milling and
the manufacture of brushes, plaster and wooden shoes. There
are a subprefecture and tribunal of first instance. Lavaur was
taken in 1211 by Simon de Montfort during the wars of the
Albigenses, and several times during the religious wars of the
16th century.</p>

Hubert L√©on Lavedan, a well-known Catholic and liberal
journalist. He contributed to various Parisian papers a series
of witty tales and dialogues of Parisian life, many of which
were collected in volume form. In 1891 he produced at the
Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais <i>Une Famille</i>, followed at the Vaudeville in
1894 by <i>Le Prince d&rsquo;Aurec</i>, a satire on the nobility, afterwards
re-named <i>Les Descendants</i>. Later brilliant and witty pieces
were <i>Les Deux noblesses</i> (1897), <i>Catherine</i> (1897), <i>Le Nouveau jeu</i>

<p><span class="bold">LAVELEYE, √âMILE LOUIS VICTOR DE<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> (1822-1892), Belgian
economist, was born at Bruges on the 5th of April 1822, and
educated there and at the Coll√®ge Stanislas in Paris, a celebrated
establishment in the hands of the Oratorians. He continued
his studies at the Catholic university of Louvain and afterwards
at Ghent, where he came under the influence of Fran√ßois Huet,
the philosopher and Christian Socialist. In 1844 he won a prize
with an essay on the language and literature of Provence. In
1847 he published <i>L&rsquo;Histoire des rois francs</i>, and in 1861 a French
version of the <i>Nibelungen</i>, but though he never lost his interest
in literature and history, his most important work was in the
domain of economics. He was one of a group of young lawyers,
doctors and critics, all old pupils of Huet, who met once a week
to discuss social and economic questions, and was thus led to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
publish his views on these subjects. In 1859 some articles
by him in the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i> laid the foundation of his
reputation as an economist. In 1864 he was elected to the chair
of political economy at the state university of Li√©ge. Here he
wrote his most important works: <i>La Russie et l&rsquo;Autriche depuis
Sadowa</i> (1870), <i>Essai sur les formes de gouvernement dans les
soci√©t√©s modernes</i> (1872), <i>Des Causes actuelles de guerre en Europe
et de l&rsquo;arbitrage</i> and <i>De la propri√©t√© et de ses formes primitives</i>
(1874), dedicated to the memory of John Stuart Mill and Fran√ßois
Huet. He died at Doyon, near Li√©ge, on the 3rd of January
1892. Laveleye&rsquo;s name is particularly connected with bimetallism
and primitive property, and he took a special interest
in the revival and preservation of small nationalities. But
his activity included the whole realm of political science, political
economy, monetary questions, international law, foreign and
Belgian politics, questions of education, religion and morality,
travel and literature. He had the art of popularizing even the
most technical subjects, owing to the clearness of his view and
his firm grasp of the matter in hand. He was especially attracted
to England, where he thought he saw many of his ideals of social,
political and religious progress realized. He was a frequent
contributor to the English newspapers and leading reviews.
The most widely circulated of his works was a pamphlet on
<i>Le Parti cl√©rical en Belgique</i>, of which 2,000,000 copies were
circulated in ten languages.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAVENDER,<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> botanically <i>Lavandula</i>, a genus of the natural
order Labiatae distinguished by an ovate tubular calyx, a two-lipped
corolla, of which the upper lip has two and the lower
three lobes, and four stamens bent downwards.</p>

<p>The plant to which the name of lavender is commonly applied,
<i>Lavandula vera</i>, is a native of the mountainous districts of the
countries bordering on the western half of the Mediterranean,
extending from the eastern coast of Spain to Calabria and
northern Africa, growing in some places at a height of 4500 ft.
above the sea-level, and preferring stony declivities in open
sunny situations. It is cultivated in the open air as far north
as Norway and Livonia. Lavender forms an evergreen under-shrub
about 2 ft. high, with greyish-green hoary linear leaves,
rolled under at the edges when young; the branches are erect
and give a bushy appearance to the plant. The flowers are
borne on a terminal spike at the summit of a long naked stalk,
the spike being composed of 6-10 dense clusters in the axils of
small, brownish, rhomboidal, tapering, opposite bracts, the
clusters being more widely separated towards the base of the
spike. The calyx is tubular, contracted towards the mouth,
marked with 13 ribs and 5-toothed, the posterior tooth being the
largest. The corolla is of a pale violet colour, but darker on
its inner surface, tubular, two-lipped, the upper lip with two and
the lower with three lobes. Both corolla and calyx are covered
with stellate hairs, amongst which are imbedded shining oil
glands to which the fragrance of the plant is due. The leaves
and flowers of lavender are said to have been used by the ancients
to perfume their baths; hence the Med. Lat. name <i>Lavandula</i> or
<i>Lavendula</i> is supposed to have been derived from <i>lavare</i>, to
wash. This derivation is considered doubtful and a connexion
has been suggested with Lat. <i>livere</i>, to be of a bluish, pale or
livid colour.</p>

<p>Although <i>L. Stoechas</i> was well known to the ancients, no
allusion unquestionably referring to <i>L. vera</i> has been found in
the writings of classical authors, the earliest mention of the
latter plant being in the 12th century by the abbess Hildegard,
who lived near Bingen on the Rhine. Under the name of
<i>llafant</i> or <i>llafantly</i> it was known to the Welsh physicians as a
medicine in the 13th century. The dried flowers have long
been used in England, the United States and other countries for
perfuming linen, and the characteristic cry of &ldquo;Lavender!
sweet lavender!&rdquo; was still to be heard in London streets at
the beginning of the 20th century. In England lavender is
cultivated chiefly for the distillation of its essential oil, of which
it yields on an average 1¬Ω% when freed from the stalks, but in
the south of Europe the flowers form an object of trade, being
exported to the Barbary states, Turkey and America.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In Great Britain lavender is grown in the parishes of Mitcham,
Carshalton and Beddington in Surrey, and in Hertfordshire in the
parish of Hitchin. The most suitable soil seems to be a sandy loam
with a calcareous substratum, and the most favourable position a
sunny slope in localities elevated above the level of fogs, where the
plant is not in danger of early frost and is freely exposed to air and
light. At Hitchin lavender is said to have been grown as early as
1568, but as a commercial speculation its cultivation dates back
only to 1823. The plants at present in cultivation do not produce
seed, and the propagation is always made by slips or by dividing the
roots. The latter plan has only been followed since 1860, when a
large number of lavender plants were killed by a severe frost. Since
that date the plants have been subject to the attack of a fungus, in
consequence of which the price of the oil has been considerably
enhanced.</p>

<p>The flowers are collected in the beginning of August, and taken
direct to the still. The yield of oil depends in great measure upon
the weather. After a wet and dull June and July the yield is sometimes
only half as much as when the weather has been bright and
sunshiny. From 12 to 30 &#8468; of oil per acre is the average amount
obtained. The oil contained in the stem has a more rank odour and is
less volatile than that of the flowers; consequently the portion that
distils over after the first hour and a half is collected separately.</p>

<p>The finest oil is obtained by the distillation of the flowers, without
the stalks, but the labour spent upon this adds about 10s. per &#8468;
to the expense of
the oil, and the
same end is practically
attained by
fractional distillation.
The oil mellows
by keeping
three years, after
which it deteriorates
unless mixed
with alcohol; it
is also improved
by redistillation.
Oil of lavender is
distilled from the
wild plants in
Piedmont and the
South of France,
especially in the
villages about
Mont Ventoux
near Avignon, and
in those some
leagues west of
Montpellier. The
best French oil
realizes scarcely
one-sixth of the
price of the English
oil. Cheaper varieties
are made by
distilling the entire
plant.</p>

<p>Oil of lavender
is a mobile liquid
having a specific
gravity from 0.85
to 0.89. Its chief
constituents are
linalool acetate,
which also occurs
in oil of bergamot,
and linalool,
C<span class="su">10</span>H<span class="su">17</span>OH, an alcohol
derived by
oxidation from
myrcene, C<span class="su">10</span>H<span class="su">16</span>,
which is one of the
terpenes. The dose
is ¬Ω-3 minims. The British pharmacopeia contains a spiritus lavandulae,
dose 5-20 minims: and a compound tincture, dose ¬Ω-1
drachm. This is contained in liquor arsenicalis, and its characteristic
odour may thus be of great practical importance, medico-legally
and otherwise. The pharmacology of oil of lavender is simply that
of an exceptionally pleasant and mild volatile oil. It is largely used
as a carminative and as a colouring and flavouring agent. Its
adulteration with alcohol may be detected by chloride of calcium
dissolving in it and forming a separate layer of liquid at the bottom
of the vessel. Glycerine acts in the same way. If it contain turpentine
it will not dissolve in three volumes of alcohol, in which quantity
the pure oil is perfectly soluble.</p>

<p>Lavender flowers were formerly considered good for &ldquo;all disorders
of the head and nerves&rdquo;; a spirit prepared with them was
known under the name of palsy drops.</p>

<p>Lavender water consists of a solution of the volatile oil in spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
of wine with the addition of the essences of musk, rose, bergamot
and ambergris, but is very rarely prepared by distillation of the
flowers with spirit.</p>

<p>In the climate of New York lavender is scarcely hardy, but in
the vicinity of Philadelphia considerable quantities are grown for
the market. In American gardens sweet basil (<i>Ocimum basilicum</i>)
is frequently called lavender.</p>

<p><i>Lavandula Spica</i>, a species which differs from <i>L. vera</i> chiefly in
its smaller size, more crowded leaves and linear bracts, is also used
for the distillation of an essential oil, which is known in England as
oil of spike and in France under the name of <i>essence d&rsquo;aspic</i>. It is
used in painting on porcelain and in veterinary medicine. The oil
as met with in commerce is less fragrant than that of <i>L. vera</i>&mdash;probably
because the whole plant is distilled, for the flowers of the
two species are scarcely distinguishable in fragrance. <i>L. Spica</i> does
not extend so far north, nor ascend the mountains beyond 2000 ft.
It cannot be cultivated in Britain except in sheltered situations.
A nearly allied species, <i>L. lanata</i>, a native of Spain, with broader
leaves, is also very fragrant, but does not appear to be distilled for
oil.</p>

<p><i>Lavandula Stoechas</i>, a species extending from the Canaries to
Asia Minor, is distinguished from the above plants by its blackish
purple flowers, and shortly stalked spikes crowned by conspicuous
purplish sterile bracts. The flowers were official in the London
pharmacopoeia as late as 1746. They are still used by the Arabs
as an expectorant and antispasmodic. The Stoechades (now called
the isles of Hy√®res near Toulon) owed their name to the abundance
of the plant growing there.</p>

<p>Other species of lavender are known, some of which extend as
far east as to India. A few which differ from the above in having
divided leaves, as <i>L. dentata</i>, <i>L. abrotanoides</i>, <i>L. multifolia</i>, <i>L.
pinnata</i> and <i>L. viridis</i>, have been cultivated in greenhouses, &amp;c., in
England.</p>

<p>Sea lavender is a name applied in England to several species of
<i>Statice</i>, a genus of littoral plants belonging to the order <i>Plumba
gineae</i>. Lavender cotton is a species of the genus <i>Santolina</i>, small,
yellow-flowered, evergreen undershrubs of the Composite order.</p>

August 1761. He demanded the suppression of the order and
thus acquired popularity. Louis XV. named him controller-general
of the finances in December 1763, but the burden was
great and Laverdy knew nothing of finance. Three months
after his nomination he forbade anything of any kind whatever
to be printed concerning his administration, thus refusing
advice as well as censure. He used all sorts of expedients,
sometimes dishonest, to replenish the treasury, and was even
accused of having himself profited from the commerce in wheat.
A court intrigue led to his sudden dismissal on the 1st of October
1768. Henceforward he lived in retirement until, during the
Revolution, he was involved in the charges against the financiers

spirits of the underworld. A cup found in an Etruscan tomb
bears the inscription &ldquo;Lavernai Pocolom,&rdquo; and in a fragment
of Septimius Serenus Laverna is expressly mentioned in connexion
with the <i>di inferi</i>. By an easy transition, she came to
be regarded as the protectress of thieves, whose operations were
associated with darkness. She had an altar on the Aventine
hill, near the gate called after her Lavernalis, and a grove on
the Via Salaria. Her aid was invoked by thieves to enable them
to carry out their plans successfully without forfeiting their
reputation for piety and honesty (Horace, <i>Ep.</i> i. 16, 60). Many
explanations have been given of the name: (1) from <i>latere</i>
(Schol. on Horace, who gives <i>laternio</i> as another form of <i>lavernio</i>
or robber); (2) from <i>lavare</i> (Acron on Horace, according to
whom thieves were called <i>lavatores</i>, perhaps referring to bath
thieves); (3) from <i>levare</i> (cf. shop-lifters). Modern etymologists
connect it with <i>lu-crum</i>, and explain it as meaning the goddess
of gain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAVIGERIE, CHARLES MARTIAL ALLEMAND<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> (1825-1892),
French divine, cardinal archbishop of Carthage and
Algiers and primate of Africa, was born at Bayonne on the
31st of October 1825, and was educated at St Sulpice, Paris. He
was ordained priest in 1849, and was professor of ecclesiastical
history at the Sorbonne from 1854 to 1856. In 1856 he accepted
the direction of the schools of the East, and was thus for the
first time brought into contact with the Mahommedan world.
&ldquo;C&rsquo;est l√†,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;que j&rsquo;ai connu enfin ma vocation.&rdquo;
Activity in missionary work, especially in alleviating the distresses
of the victims of the Druses, soon brought him prominently
into notice; he was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour,
and in October 1861, shortly after his return to Europe, was
appointed French auditor at Rome. Two years later he was
raised to the see of Nancy, where he remained for four years,
during which the diocese became one of the best administered
in France. While bishop of Nancy he met Marshal MacMahon,
then governor-general of Algeria, who in 1866 offered him the
see of Algiers, just raised to an archbishopric. Lavigerie landed
in Africa on the 11th of May 1868, when the great famine was
already making itself felt, and he began in November to collect
the orphans into villages. This action, however, did not meet
with the approval of MacMahon, who feared that the Arabs
would resent it as an infraction of the religious peace, and thought
that the Mahommedan church, being a state institution in Algeria,
ought to be protected from proselytism; so it was intimated
to the prelate that his sole duty was to minister to the colonists.
Lavigerie, however, continued his self-imposed task, refused
the archbishopric of Lyons, which was offered to him by the
emperor, and won his point. Contact with the natives during
the famine caused Lavigerie to entertain exaggerated hopes
for their general conversion, and his enthusiasm was such that
he offered to resign his archbishopric in order to devote himself
entirely to the missions. Pius IX. refused this, but granted
him a coadjutor, and placed the whole of equatorial Africa under
his charge. In 1870 Lavigerie warmly supported papal infallibility.
In 1871 he was twice a candidate for the National
Assembly, but was defeated. In 1874 he founded the Sahara
and Sudan mission, and sent missionaries to Tunis, Tripoli,
East Africa and the Congo. The order of African missionaries
thus founded, for which Lavigerie himself drew up the rule,
has since become famous as the <i>P√®res Blancs</i>. From 1881
to 1884 his activity in Tunisia so raised the prestige of France
that it drew from Gambetta the celebrated declaration, <i>L&rsquo;Anticl√©ricalisme
n&rsquo;est pas un article d&rsquo;exportation</i>, and led to the
exemption of Algeria from the application of the decrees concerning
the religious orders. On the 27th of March 1882 the dignity
of cardinal was conferred upon Lavigerie, but the great object
of his ambition was to restore the see of St Cyprian; and in
that also he was successful, for by a bull of 10th November 1884
the metropolitan see of Carthage was re-erected, and Lavigerie
received the pallium on the 25th of January 1885. The later
years of his life were spent in ardent anti-slavery propaganda,
and his eloquence moved large audiences in London, as well
as in Paris, Brussels and other parts of the continent. He hoped,
by organizing a fraternity of armed laymen as pioneers, to
restore fertility to the Sahara; but this community did not
succeed, and was dissolved before his death. In 1890 Lavigerie
appeared in the new character of a politician, and arranged
with Pope Leo XIII. to make an attempt to reconcile the church
with the republic. He invited the officers of the Mediterranean
squadron to lunch at Algiers, and, practically renouncing his
monarchical sympathies, to which he clung as long as the comte
de Chambord was alive, expressed his support of the republic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>294</span>
and emphasized it by having the Marseillaise played by a band
of his <i>P√®res Blancs</i>. The further steps in this evolution emanated
from the pope, and Lavigerie, whose health now began to fail,
receded comparatively into the background. He died at Algiers
on the 26th of November 1892.</p>

of July 1815. He was descended from an old Breton family,
which counted among its members a Hersart who had followed
Saint Louis to the Crusade, and another who was a companion
in arms of Du Guesclin. La Villemarqu√© devoted himself to
the elucidation of the monuments of Breton literature. Introduced
in 1851 by Jacob Grimm as correspondent to the Academy
of Berlin, he became in 1858 a member of the Academy of
Inscriptions. His works include: <i>Contes populaires des anciens
Bretons</i> (1842), to which was prefixed an essay on the origin of
the romances of the Round Table; <i>Essai sur l&rsquo;histoire de la
langue bretonne</i> (1837); <i>Po√®mes des bardes bretons du sixi√®me
si√®cle</i> (1850); <i>La L√©gende celtique en Irelande, en Cambrie et en
Bretagne</i> (1859). The popular Breton songs published by him
in 1839 as <i>Barzaz Breiz</i> were considerably retouched. La
Villemarqu√©&rsquo;s work has been superseded by the work of later
scholars, but he has the merit of having done much to arouse
popular interest in his subject. He died at Keransker on the
8th of December 1895.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAVINIUM,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> an ancient town of Latium, on the so-called Via
Lavinatis (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Laurentina, Via</a></span>), 19 m. S. of Rome, the modern
<span class="sc">Pratica</span>, situated 300 ft. above sea-level and 2¬Ω m. N.E. from
the sea-coast. Its foundation is attributed to Aeneas (whereas
Laurentum was the primitive city of King Latinus), who named
it after his wife Lavinia. It is rarely mentioned in Roman history
and often confused with Lanuvium or Lanivium in the text
both of authors and of inscriptions. The custom by which the
consuls and praetors or dictators sacrificed on the Alban Mount
and at Lavinium to the Penates and to Vesta, before they entered
upon office or departed for their province, seems to have been
one of great antiquity. There is no trace of its having continued
into imperial times, but the cults of Lavinium were kept up,
largely by the imperial appointment of honorary non-resident
citizens to hold the priesthoods. The citizens of Lavinium were
known under the empire as Laurentes Lavinates, and the place
itself at a late period as Laurolavinium. It was deserted or
forgotten not long after the time of Theodosius.</p>

<p>Lavinium was preceded by a more ancient town, <span class="sc">Laurentum</span>,
the city of Latinus (Verg. <i>Aen.</i> viii.); of this the site is uncertain,
but it is probably to be sought at the modern Tor Paterno,
close to the sea-coast and 5 m. N. by W. of Lavinium. Here
the name of Laurentum is preserved by the modern name Pantan
di Lauro. Even in ancient times it was famous for its groves
of bay-trees (<i>laurus</i>) from which its name was perhaps derived,
and which in imperial times gave the villas of its territory a name
for salubrity, so that both Vitellius and Commodus resorted
there. The exact date of the abandonment of the town itself
and the incorporation of its territory with that of Lavinium
is uncertain, but it may be placed in the latter part of the republic.
Under the empire a portion of it must have been imperial domain
and forest. We hear of an imperial, procurator in charge of
the elephants at Laurentum; and the imperial villa may perhaps
be identified with the extensive ruins at Tor Paterno itself.
The remains of numerous other villas lie along the ancient
coast-line (which was half a mile inland of the modern, being
now marked by a row of sand-hills, and was followed by the
Via Severiana), both north-west and south-east of Tor Paterno:
they extended as a fact in an almost unbroken line along the low
sandy coast&mdash;now entirely deserted and largely occupied by
the low scrub which serves as cover for the wild boars of the king
of Italy&rsquo;s preserves&mdash;from the mouth of the Tiber to Antium,
and thence again to Astura; but there are no traces of any
buildings previous to the imperial period. In one of these
villas, excavated by the king of Italy in 1906, was found a fine
replica of the famous discobolus of Myron. The plan of the building
is interesting, as it diverges entirely from the normal type
and adapts itself to the site. Some way to the N.W. was situated
the village of Vicus Augustanus Laurentium, taking its name
probably from Augustus himself, and probably identical with
the village mentioned by Pliny the younger as separated by
only one villa from his own. This village was brought to light
by excavation in 1874, and its forum and curia are still visible.
The remains of the villa of Pliny, too, were excavated in 1713
and in 1802-1819, and it is noteworthy that the place bears
the name Villa di Pino (sic) on the staff map; how old the name
is, is uncertain. It is impossible without further excavation
to reconcile the remains&mdash;mainly of substructions&mdash;with the
elaborate description of his villa given by Pliny (cf. H. Winnefeld
in <i>Jahrbuch des Instituts</i>, 1891, 200 seq.).</p>

<p>The site of the ancient Lavinium, no less than 300 ft. above
sea-level and 2¬Ω m. inland, is far healthier than the low-lying
Laurentum, where, except in the immediate vicinity of the coast,
malaria must have been a dreadful scourge. It possesses considerable
natural strength, and consists of a small hill, the
original acropolis, occupied by the modern castle and the village
surrounding it, and a larger one, now given over to cultivation,
where the city stood. On the former there are now no traces
of antiquity, but on the latter are scanty remains of the city
walls, in small blocks of the grey-green tufa (<i>cappellaccio</i>)
which is used in the earliest buildings of Rome, and traces of the
streets. The necropolis, too, has been discovered, but not systematically
excavated; but objects of the first Iron age, including
a sword of Aegean type (thus confirming the tradition),
have been found; also remains of a building with Doric columns
of an archaistic type, remains of later buildings in brick, and
inscriptions, some of them of considerable interest.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAVISSE, ERNEST<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (1842-&emsp;&emsp;), French historian, was born
at Nouvion-en-Thi√©rache, Aisne, on the 17th of December 1842.
In 1865 he obtained a fellowship in history, and in 1875 became
a doctor of letters; he was appointed <i>ma√Ætre de conf√©rence</i> (1876)
at the √©cole normale sup√©rieure, succeeding Fustel de Coulanges,
and then professor of modern history at the Sorbonne (1888),
in the place of Henri Wallon. He was an eloquent professor
and very fond of young people, and played an important part
in the revival of higher studies in France after 1871. His knowledge
of pedagogy was displayed in his public lectures and his
addresses, in his private lessons, where he taught a small number
of pupils the historical method, and in his books, where he wrote
<i>ad probandum</i> at least as much as <i>ad narrandum</i>: class-books,
collections of articles, intermingled with personal reminiscences
(<i>Questions d&rsquo;enseignement national</i>, 1885; <i>√âtudes et √©tudiants</i>,
1890; <i>√Ä propos de nos √©coles</i>, 1895), rough historical sketches
(<i>Vue g√©n√©rale de l&rsquo;histoire politique de l&rsquo;Europe</i>, 1890), &amp;c. Even
his works of learning, written without a trace of pedantry, are
remarkable for their lucidity and vividness.</p>

<p>After the Franco-Prussian War Lavisse studied the development
of Prussia and wrote <i>√âtude sur l&rsquo;une des origines de la
monarchie prussienne, ou la Marche de Brandebourg sous la
dynastie ascanienne</i>, which was his thesis for his doctor&rsquo;s degree
in 1875, and <i>√âtudes sur l&rsquo;histoire de la Prusse</i> (1879). In connexion
with his study of the Holy Roman Empire, and the cause
of its decline, he wrote a number of articles which were published
in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>; and he wrote <i>Trois empereurs
d&rsquo;Allemagne</i> (1888), <i>La Jeunesse du grand Fr√©d√©ric</i> (1891) and
<i>Fr√©d√©ric II. avant son av√®nement</i> (1893) when studying the
modern German empire and the grounds for its strength. With
his friend Alfred Rambaud he conceived the plan of <i>L&rsquo;Histoire
g√©n√©rale du IV<span class="sp">e</span> si√®cle jusqu&rsquo;√† nos jours</i>, to which, however, he
contributed nothing. He edited the <i>Histoire de France depuis
les origines jusqu&rsquo;√† la R√©volution</i> (1901-&emsp;&emsp;), in which he carefully
revised the work of his numerous assistants, reserving the
greatest part of the reign of Louis XIV. for himself. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span>
section occupies the whole of volume vii. It is a remarkable
piece of work, and the sketch of absolute government in France
during this period has never before been traced with an equal
amount of insight and brilliance. Lavisse was admitted to the
Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise on the death of Admiral Jurien de la
Gravi√®re in 1892, and after the death of James Darmesteter
became editor of the <i>Revue de Paris</i>. He is, however, chiefly
a master of pedagogy. When the √©cole normale was joined to
the university of Paris, Lavisse was appointed director of the
new organization, which he had helped more than any one to
bring about.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAVOISIER, ANTOINE LAURENT<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (1743-1794), French
chemist, was born in Paris on the 26th of August 1743. His father,
an <i>avocat au parlement</i>, gave him an excellent education at the
coll√®ge Mazarin, and encouraged his taste for natural science;
and he studied mathematics and astronomy with N. L. de
Lacaille, chemistry with the elder Rouelle and botany with
Bernard de Jussieu. In 1766 he received a gold medal from the
Academy of Sciences for an essay on the best means of lighting
a large town; and among his early work were papers on the
analysis of gypsum, on thunder, on the aurora and on congelation,
and a refutation of the prevalent belief that water by
repeated distillation is converted into earth. He also assisted
J. E. Guettard (1715-1786) in preparing his mineralogical atlas
of France. In 1768, recognized as a man who had both the
ability and the means for a scientific career, he was nominated
<i>adjoint chimiste</i> to the Academy, and in that capacity made
numerous reports on the most diverse subjects, from the theory
of colours to water-supply and from invalid chairs to mesmerism
and the divining rod. The same year he obtained the position
of <i>adjoint</i> to Baudon, one of the farmers-general of the revenue,
subsequently becoming a full titular member of the body.
This was the first of a series of posts in which his administrative
abilities found full scope. Appointed <i>r√©gisseur des poudres</i> in
1775, he not only abolished the vexatious search for saltpetre
in the cellars of private houses, but increased the production
of the salt and improved the manufacture of gunpowder. In
1785 he was nominated to the committee on agriculture, and as
its secretary drew up reports and instructions on the cultivation
of various crops, and promulgated schemes for the establishment
of experimental agricultural stations, the distribution of agricultural
implements and the adjustment of rights of pasturage.
Seven years before he had started a model farm at Fr√©chine,
where he demonstrated the advantages of scientific methods of
cultivation and of the introduction of good breeds of cattle and
sheep. Chosen a member of the provincial assembly of Orleans
in 1787, he busied himself with plans for the improvement of
the social and economic conditions of the community by means
of savings banks, insurance societies, canals, workhouses, &amp;c.;
and he showed the sincerity of his philanthropical work by
advancing money out of his own pocket, without interest, to
the towns of Blois and Romorantin, for the purchase of barley
during the famine of 1788. Attached in this same year to the
<i>caisse d&rsquo;escompte</i>, he presented the report of its operations to
the national assembly in 1789, and as commissary of the treasury
in 1791 he established a system of accounts of unexampled
punctuality. He was also asked by the national assembly to
draw up a new scheme of taxation in connexion with which he
produced a report <i>De la richesse territoriale de la France</i>, and
he was further associated with committees on hygiene, coinage,
the casting of cannon, &amp;c., and was secretary and treasurer of
the commission appointed in 1790 to secure uniformity of weights
and measures.</p>

<p>In 1791, when Lavoisier was in the middle of all this official
activity, the suppression of the farmers-general marked the
beginning of troubles which brought about his death. His
membership of that body was alone sufficient to make him an
object of suspicion; his administration at the <i>r√©gie des poudres</i>
was attacked; and Marat accused him in the <i>Ami du Peuple</i>
of putting Paris in prison and of stopping the circulation of air
in the city by the <i>mur d&rsquo;octroi</i> erected at his suggestion in 1787.
The Academy, of which as treasurer at the time he was a conspicuous
member, was regarded by the convention with no
friendly eyes as being tainted with &ldquo;incivism,&rdquo; and in the
spring of 1792 A. F. Fourcroy endeavoured to persuade it to
purge itself of suspected members. The attempt was unsuccessful,
but in August of the same year Lavoisier had to leave his
house and laboratory at the Arsenal, and in November the
Academy was forbidden until further orders to fill up the vacancies
in its numbers. Next year, on the 1st of August, the convention
passed a decree for the uniformity of weights and measures, and
requested the Academy to take measures for carrying it out,
but a week later Fourcroy persuaded the same convention to
suppress the Academy together with other literary societies
<i>patent√©es et dot√©es</i> by the nation. In November it ordered the
arrest of the ex-farmers-general, and on the advice of the committee
of public instruction, of which Guyton de Morveau and
Fourcroy were members, the names of Lavoisier and others
were struck off from the commission of weights and measures.
The fate of the ex-farmers-general was sealed on the 2nd of
May 1794, when, on the proposal of Antoine Dupin, one of their
former officials, the convention sent them for trial by the Revolutionary
tribunal. Within a week Lavoisier and 27 others
were condemned to death. A petition in his favour addressed
to Coffinhal, the president of the tribunal, is said to have been
met with the reply <i>La R√©publique n&rsquo;a pas besoin de savants</i>,
and on the 8th of the month Lavoisier and his companions
were guillotined at the Place de la R√©volution. He died fourth,
and was preceded by his colleague Jacques Paulze, whose
daughter he had married in 1771. &ldquo;<i>Il ne leur a fallu</i>,&rdquo; Lagrange
remarked, &ldquo;<i>qu&rsquo;un moment pour faire tomber cette t√™te, et cent
ann√©es peut-√™tre ne suffiront pas pour en reproduire une
semblable</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavoisier&rsquo;s name is indissolubly associated with the overthrow
of the phlogistic doctrine that had dominated the development
of chemistry for over a century, and with the establishment
of the foundations upon which the modern science reposes. &ldquo;He
discovered,&rdquo; says Justus von Liebig (<i>Letters on Chemistry</i>, No. 3),
&ldquo;no new body, no new property, no natural phenomenon
previously unknown; but all the facts established by him were
the necessary consequences of the labours of those who preceded
him. His merit, his immortal glory, consists in this&mdash;that he
infused into the body of the science a new spirit; but all the
members of that body were already in existence, and rightly
joined together.&rdquo; Realizing that the total weight of all the
products of a chemical reaction must be exactly equal to the
total weight of the reacting substances, he made the balance
the <i>ultima ratio</i> of the laboratory, and he was able to draw
correct inferences from his weighings because, unlike many of the
phlogistonists, he looked upon heat as imponderable. It was by
weighing that in 1770 he proved that water is not converted into
earth by distillation, for he showed that the total weight of a
sealed glass vessel and the water it contained remained constant,
however long the water was boiled, but that the glass vessel
lost weight to an extent equal to the weight of earth produced,
his inference being that the earth came from the glass, not from
the water. On the 1st of November 1772 he deposited with the
Academy a sealed note which stated that sulphur and phosphorus
when burnt increased in weight because they absorbed
&ldquo;air,&rdquo; while the metallic lead formed from litharge by reduction
with charcoal weighed less than the original litharge because it
had lost &ldquo;air.&rdquo; The exact nature of the airs concerned in the
processes he did not explain until after the preparation of
&ldquo;dephlogisticated air&rdquo; (oxygen) by Priestley in 1774. Then,
perceiving that in combustion and the calcination of metals only
a portion of a given volume of common air was used up, he
concluded that Priestley&rsquo;s new air, <i>air √©minemment pur</i>, was what
was absorbed by burning phosphorus, &amp;c., &ldquo;non-vital air,&rdquo;
azote, or nitrogen remaining behind. The gas given off in the
reduction of metallic calces by charcoal he at first supposed to
be merely that contained in the calx, but he soon came to understand
that it was a product formed by the union of the charcoal
with the &ldquo;dephlogisticated air&rdquo; in the calx. In a memoir
presented to the Academy in 1777, but not published till 1782,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span>
he assigned to dephlogisticated air the name oxygen, or &ldquo;acid-producer,&rdquo;
on the supposition that all acids were formed by its
union with a simple, usually non-metallic, body; and having
verified this notion for phosphorus, sulphur, charcoal, &amp;c., and
even extended it to the vegetable acids, he naturally asked
himself what was formed by the combustion of &ldquo;inflammable
air&rdquo; (hydrogen). This problem he had attacked in 1774, and
in subsequent years he made various attempts to discover the
acid which, under the influence of his oxygen theory, he expected
would be formed. It was not till the 25th of June 1783 that in
conjunction with Laplace he announced to the Academy that
water was the product formed by the combination of hydrogen
and oxygen, but by that time he had been anticipated by
Cavendish, to whose prior work, however, as to that of several
other investigators in other matters, it is to be regretted that
he did not render due acknowledgment. But a knowledge of the
composition of water enabled him to storm the last defences of
the phlogistonists. Hydrogen they held to be the phlogiston of
metals, and they supported this view by pointing out that it was
liberated when metals were dissolved in acids. Considerations
of weight had long prevented Lavoisier from accepting this
doctrine, but he was now able to explain the process fully,
showing that the hydrogen evolved did not come from the metal
itself, but was one product of the decomposition of the water of
the dilute acid, the other product, oxygen, combining with the
metal to form an oxide which in turn united with the acid. A
little later this same knowledge led him to the beginnings of
quantitative organic analysis. Knowing that the water produced
by the combustion of alcohol was not pre-existent in that substance
but was formed by the combination of its hydrogen with
the oxygen of the air, he burnt alcohol and other combustible
organic substances, such as wax and oil, in a known volume of
oxygen, and, from the weight of the water and carbon dioxide
produced and his knowledge of their composition, was able to
calculate the amounts of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen present
in the substance.</p>

<p>Up to about this time Lavoisier&rsquo;s work, mainly quantitative
in character, had appealed most strongly to physicists, but it
now began to win conviction from chemists also. C. L. Berthollet,
L. B. Guyton de Morveau and A. F. Fourcroy, his collaborators
in the reformed system of chemical terminology set forth in 1787
in the <i>M√©thode de <span class="correction" title="amended from momenclature">nomenclature</span> chimique</i>, were among the earliest
French converts, and they were followed by M. H. Klaproth and
the German Academy, and by most English chemists except
Cavendish, who rather suspended his judgment, and Priestley,
who stubbornly clung to the opposite view. Indeed, though the
partisans of phlogiston did not surrender without a struggle,
the history of science scarcely presents a second instance of a
change so fundamental accomplished with such ease. The
spread of Lavoisier&rsquo;s doctrines was greatly facilitated by the
defined and logical form in which he presented them in his
<i>Trait√© √©l√©mentaire de chimie</i> (<i>pr√©sent√© dans un ordre nouveau et
d&rsquo;apr√®s les d√©couvertes modernes</i>) (1789). The list of simple
substances contained in the first volume of this work includes
light and caloric with oxygen, azote and hydrogen. Under the
head of &ldquo;oxidable or acidifiable&rdquo; substances, the combination
of which with oxygen yielded acids, were placed sulphur, phosphorus,
carbon, and the muriatic, fluoric and boracic <span class="correction" title="amended from radicles">radicals</span>.
The metals, which by combination with oxygen became oxides,
were antimony, silver, arsenic, bismuth, cobalt, copper, tin, iron,
manganese, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, gold, platinum, lead,
tungsten and zinc; and the &ldquo;simple earthy salifiable substances&rdquo;
were lime, baryta, magnesia, alumina and silica.
The simple nature of the alkalies Lavoisier considered so doubtful
that he did not class them as elements, which he conceived as
substances which could not be further decomposed by any
known process of analysis&mdash;<i>les mol√©cules simples et indivisibles
qui composent les corps</i>. The union of any two of the elements
gave rise to binary compounds, such as oxides, acids, sulphides,
&amp;c. A substance containing three elements was a binary compound
of the second order; thus salts, the most important
compounds of this class, were formed by the union of acids and
oxides, iron sulphate, for instance, being a compound of iron
oxide with sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>In addition to his purely chemical work, Lavoisier, mostly in
conjunction with Laplace, devoted considerable attention to
physical problems, especially those connected with heat. The
two carried out some of the earliest thermochemical investigations,
devised apparatus for measuring linear and cubical
expansions, and employed a modification of Joseph Black&rsquo;s ice
calorimeter in a series of determinations of specific heats.
Regarding heat (<i>mati√®re de feu</i> or <i>fluide ign√©</i>) as a peculiar kind
of imponderable matter, Lavoisier held that the three states of
aggregation&mdash;solid, liquid and gas&mdash;were modes of matter, each
depending on the amount of <i>mati√®re de feu</i> with which the ponderable
substances concerned were interpenetrated and combined;
and this view enabled him correctly to anticipate that
gases would be reduced to liquids and solids by the influence of
cold and pressure. He also worked at fermentation, respiration
and animal heat, looking upon the processes concerned as
essentially chemical in nature. A paper discovered many years
after his death showed that he had anticipated later thinkers
in explaining the cyclical process of animal and vegetable life,
for he pointed out that plants derive their food from the air,
from water, and in general from the mineral kingdom, and
animals in turn feed on plants or on other animals fed by plants,
while the materials thus taken up by plants and animals are
restored to the mineral kingdom by the breaking-down processes
of fermentation, putrefaction and combustion.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA VOISIN.<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> <span class="sc">Catherine Monvoisin</span>, known as &ldquo;La Voisin&rdquo;
(d. 1680), French sorceress, whose maiden name was Catherine
Deshayes, was one of the chief personages in the famous <i>affaire
des poisons</i>, which disgraced the reign of Louis XIV. Her
husband, Monvoisin, was an unsuccessful jeweller, and she
practised chiromancy and face-reading to retrieve their fortunes.
She gradually added the practice of witchcraft, in which she had
the help of a renegade priest, √âtienne Guibourg, whose part
was the celebration of the &ldquo;black mass,&rdquo; an abominable parody
in which the host was compounded of the blood of a little child
mixed with horrible ingredients. She practised medicine,
especially midwifery, procured abortion and provided love
powders and poisons. Her chief accomplice was one of her lovers,
the magician Lesage, whose real name was Adam C&oelig;uret. The
great ladies of Paris flocked to La Voisin, who accumulated
enormous wealth. Among her clients were Olympe Mancini,
comtesse de Soissons, who sought the death of the king&rsquo;s mistress,
Louise de la Valli√®re; Mme de Montespan, Mme de Gramont
(<i>la belle</i> Hamilton) and others. The bones of toads, the teeth of
moles, cantharides, iron filings, human blood and human dust
were among the ingredients of the love powders concocted by
La Voisin. Her knowledge of poisons was not apparently so
thorough as that of less well-known sorcerers, or it would be
difficult to account for La Valli√®re&rsquo;s immunity. The art of
poisoning had become a regular science. The death of Henrietta,
duchess of Orleans, was attributed, falsely it is true, to poison,
and the crimes of Marie Madeleine de Brinvilliers (executed in
1676) and her accomplices were still fresh in the public mind.
In April 1679 a commission appointed to inquire into the subject
and to prosecute the offenders met for the first time. Its proceedings,
including some suppressed in the official records, are
preserved in the notes of one of the official <i>rapporteurs</i>, Gabriel
Nicolas de la Reynie. The revelation of the treacherous intention

of Mme de Montespan to poison Louis XIV. and of other crimes,
planned by personages who could not be attacked without
scandal which touched the throne, caused Louis XIV. to close
the <i>chambre ardente</i>, as the court was called, on the 1st of October
1680. It was reopened on the 19th of May 1681 and sat until
the 21st of July 1682. Many of the culprits escaped through
private influence. Among these were Marie Anne Mancini,
duchesse de Bouillon, who had sought to get rid of her husband
in order to marry the duke of Vend√¥me, though Louis XIV.
banished her to N√©rac. Mme de Montespan was not openly
disgraced, because the preservation of Louis&rsquo;s own dignity was
essential, and some hundred prisoners, among them the infamous
Guibourg and Lesage, escaped the scaffold through the suppression
of evidence insisted on by Louis XIV. and Louvois. Some of
these were imprisoned in various fortresses, with instructions
from Louvois to the respective commandants to flog them if they
sought to impart what they knew. Some innocent persons were
imprisoned for life because they had knowledge of the facts.
La Voisin herself was executed at an early stage of the proceedings,
on the 20th of February 1680, after a perfunctory application
of torture. The authorities had every reason to avoid
further revelations. Thirty-five other prisoners were executed;
five were sent to the galleys and twenty-three were banished.
Their crimes had furnished one of the most extraordinary trials
known to history.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAW, JOHN<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> (1671-1729), Scots economist, best known as the
originator of the &ldquo;Mississippi scheme,&rdquo; was born at Edinburgh
in April 1671. His father, a goldsmith and banker, bought
shortly before his death, which took place in his son&rsquo;s youth,
the lands of Lauriston near Edinburgh. John lived at home
till he was twenty, and then went to London. He had already
studied mathematics, and the theory of commerce and political
economy, with much interest; but he was known rather as fop
than scholar. In London he gambled, drank and flirted till in
April 1694 a love intrigue resulted in a duel with Beau Wilson
in Bloomsbury Square. Law killed his antagonist, and was
condemned to death. His life was spared, but he was detained
in prison. He found means to escape to Holland, then the
greatest commercial country in Europe. Here he observed
with close attention the practical working of banking and
financial business, and conceived the first ideas of his celebrated
&ldquo;system.&rdquo; After a few years spent in foreign travel, he returned
to Scotland, then exhausted and enraged by the failure of the
Darien expedition (1695-1701). He propounded plans for the
relief of his country in a work<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> entitled <i>Money and Trade
Considered, with a Proposal for supplying the Nation with Money</i>
(1705). This attracted some notice, but had no practical effect,
and Law again betook himself to travel. He visited Brussels,
Paris, Vienna, Genoa, Rome, making large sums by gambling
and speculation, and spending them lavishly. He was in Paris in
1708, and made some proposals to the government as to their
financial difficulties, but Louis XIV. declined to treat with a
&ldquo;Huguenot,&rdquo; and d&rsquo;Argenson, chief of the police, had Law
expelled as a suspicious character. He had, however, become
intimately acquainted with the duke of Orleans, and when in
1715 that prince became regent, Law at once returned to Paris.</p>

<p>The extravagant expenditure of the late monarch had plunged
the kingdom into apparently inextricable financial confusion.
The debt was 3000 million livres, the estimated annual expenditure,
exclusive of interest payments, 148 million livres, and the
income about the same. The advisability of declaring a national
bankruptcy was seriously discussed, and though this plan was
rejected, measures hardly less violent were carried. By a <i>visa</i>,
or examination of the state liabilities by a committee with
full powers of quashing claims, the debt was reduced nearly
a half, the coin in circulation was ordered to be called in and
reissued at the rate of 120 for 100&mdash;a measure by which foreign
coiners profited greatly, and a chamber of justice was established
to punish speculators, to whom the difficulties of the state were
ascribed. These measures had so little success that the <i>billets
d&rsquo;√©tat</i> which were issued as part security for the new debt at
once sank 75% below their nominal value. At this crisis Law
unfolded a vast scheme to the perplexed regent. A royal bank
was to manage the trade and currency of the kingdom, to collect
the taxes, and to free the country from debt. The council of
finance, then under the duc de Noailles, opposed the plan, but
the regent allowed Law to take some tentative steps. By an
edict of 2nd May 1716, a private institution called <i>La Banque
g√©n√©rale</i>, and managed by Law, was founded. The capital was
6 million livres, divided into 1200 shares of 5000 livres, payable
in four instalments, one-fourth in cash, three-fourths in <i>billets
d&rsquo;√©tat</i>. It was to perform the ordinary functions of a bank,
and had power to issue notes payable at sight in the weight and
value of the money mentioned at day of issue. The bank was
a great and immediate success. By providing for the absorption
of part of the state paper it raised the credit of the government.
The notes were a most desirable medium of exchange, for they
had the element of fixity of value, which, owing to the arbitrary
mint decrees of the government, was wanting in the coin of the
realm. They proved the most convenient instruments of remittance
between the capital and the provinces, and they thus
developed the industries of the latter. The rate of interest,
previously enormous and uncertain, fell first to 6 and then to
4%; and when another decree (10th April 1717) ordered
collectors of taxes to receive notes as payments, and to change
them for coin at request, the bank so rose in favour that it soon
had a note-issue of 60 million livres. Law now gained the full
confidence of the regent, and was allowed to proceed with the
development of the &ldquo;system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trade of the region about the Mississippi had been granted
to a speculator named Crozat. He found the undertaking too
large, and was glad to give it up. By a decree of August 1717
Law was allowed to establish the <i>Compagnie de la Louisiane ou
d&rsquo;Occident</i>, and to endow it with privileges practically amounting
to sovereignty over the most fertile region of North America.
The capital was 100 million livres divided into 200,000 shares
of 500 livres. The payments were to be one-fourth in coin and
three-fourths in <i>billets d&rsquo;√©tat</i>. On these last the government
was to pay 3 million livres interest yearly to the company.
As the state paper was depreciated the shares fell much below
par. The rapid rise of Law had made him many enemies, and
they took advantage of this to attack the system. D&rsquo;Argenson,
now head of the council of finance, with the brothers Paris of
Grenoble, famous tax farmers of the day, formed what was called
the &ldquo;anti-system.&rdquo; The farming of the taxes was let to them,
under an assumed name, for 48¬Ω million livres yearly. A company
was formed, the exact counterpart of the Mississippi company.
The capital was the same, divided in the same manner, but the
payments were to be entirely in money. The returns from the
public revenue were sure; those from the Mississippi scheme
were not. Hence the shares of the latter were for some time out
of favour. Law proceeded unmoved with the development of
his plans. On the 4th of December 1718 the bank became a
government institution under the name of <i>La Banque royale</i>.
Law was director, and the king guaranteed the notes. The
shareholders were repaid in coin, and, to widen the influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>298</span>
of the new institution, the transport of money between towns
where it had branches was forbidden. The paper-issue now
reached 110 millions. Law had such confidence in the success
of his plans that he agreed to take over shares in the Mississippi
company at par at a near date. The shares began rapidly to rise.
The next move was to unite the companies <i>Des Indes Orientales</i>
and <i>De Chine</i>, founded in 1664 and 1713 respectively, but now
dwindled away to a shadow, to his company. The united association,
<i>La Compagnie des Indes</i>, had a practical monopoly of the
foreign trade of France. These proceedings necessitated the
creation of new capital to the nominal amount of 25 million livres.
The payment was spread over 20 months. Every holder of four
original shares (<i>m√®res</i>) could purchase one of the new shares
(<i>filles</i>) at a premium of 50 livres. All these 500-livre shares
rapidly rose to 750, or 50% above par. Law now turned his
attention to obtaining additional powers within France itself.
On the 25th of July 1719 an edict was issued granting the
company for nine years the management of the mint and the
coin-issue. For this privilege the company paid 5 million livres,
and the money was raised by a new issue of shares of the nominal
value of 500 livres, but with a premium of other 500. The list
was only open for twenty days, and it was necessary to present
four <i>m√®res</i> and one <i>fille</i> in order to obtain one of the new shares
(<i>petites filles</i>). At the same time two dividends per annum of
6% each were promised. Again there was an attempt to ruin
the bank by the commonplace expedient of making a run on
it for coin; but the conspirators had to meet absolute power
managed with fearlessness and skill. An edict appeared reducing,
at a given date, the value of money, and those who had withdrawn
coin from the bank hastened again to exchange it for the
more stable notes. Public confidence in Law was increased,
and he was enabled rapidly to proceed with the completion of
the system. A decree of 27th August 1719 deprived the rival
company of the farming of the revenue, and gave it to the
<i>Compagnie des Indes</i> for nine years in return for an annual
payment of 52 million livres. Thus at one blow the &ldquo;anti-system&rdquo;
was crushed. One thing yet remained; Law proposed
to take over the national debt, and manage it on terms advantageous
to the state. The mode of transfer was this. The debt
was over 1500 million livres. Notes were to be issued to that
amount, and with these the state creditors must be paid in a
certain order. Shares were to be issued at intervals corresponding
to the payments, and it was expected that the notes would be
used in buying them. The government was to pay 3% for the
loan. It had formerly been bound to pay 80 millions, it would
now pay under 50, a clear gain of over 30. As the shares of
the company were almost the only medium for investment,
the transfer would be surely effected. The creditors would
now look to the government payments and the commercial
gains of the company for their annual returns. Indeed the
creditors were often not able to procure the shares, for each
succeeding issue was immediately seized upon, though the 500-livre
share was now issued at a premium of 4500 livres. After
the third issue, on the 2nd of October, the shares immediately
resold at 8000 livres in the Rue Quincampoix, then used as a
bourse. They went on rapidly rising as new privileges were
still granted to the company. Law had now more than regal
power. The exiled Stuarts paid him court; the proudest
aristocracy in Europe humbled themselves before him; and his
liberality made him the idol of the populace. After, as a necessary
preliminary, becoming a Catholic, he was made controller-general
of the finances in place of d&rsquo;Argenson. Finally, in
February 1720, the bank was in name as well as in reality united
to the company.</p>

<p>The system was now complete; but it had already begun to
decay. In December 1719 it was at its height. The shares
had then amounted to 20,000 livres, forty times their nominal
price. A sort of madness possessed the nation. Men sold their
all and hastened to Paris to speculate. The population of the
capital was increased by an enormous influx of provincials and
foreigners. Trade received a vast though unnatural impulse.
Everybody seemed to be getting richer, no one poorer. Those
who could still reflect saw that this prosperity was not real.
The whole issue of shares at the extreme market-price valued
12,000 million livres. It would require 600 million annual
revenue to give a 5% dividend on this. Now, the whole income
of the company as yet was hardly sufficient to pay 5% on the
original capital of 1677 million livres. The receipts from the
taxes, &amp;c., could be precisely calculated, and it would be many
years before the commercial undertakings of the company&mdash;with
which only some trifling beginning had been made&mdash;would
yield any considerable return. People began to sell their
shares, and to buy coin, houses, land&mdash;anything that had a stable
element of value in it. There was a rapid fall in the shares,
a rapid rise in all kinds of property, and consequently a rapid
depreciation of the paper money. Law met these new tendencies
by a succession of the most violent edicts. The notes were to
bear a premium over specie. Coin was only to be used in small
payments, and only a small amount was to be kept in the possession
of private parties. The use of diamonds, the fabrication of
gold and silver plate, was forbidden. A dividend of 40% on the
original capital was promised. By several ingenious but fallaciously
reasoned pamphlets Law endeavoured to restore public
confidence. The shares still fell. At last, on the 5th of March
1720, an edict appeared fixing their price at 9000 livres, and
ordering the bank to buy and sell them at that price. The fall
now was transferred to the notes, of which there were soon over
2500 million livres in circulation. A large proportion of the coined
money was removed from the kingdom. Prices rose enormously.
There was everywhere distress and complete financial confusion.
Law became an object of popular hatred. He lost his court influence,
and was obliged to consent to a decree (21st May 1720)
by which the notes and consequently the shares were reduced
to half their nominal value. This created such a commotion that
its promoters were forced to recall it, but the mischief was done.
What confidence could there be in the depreciated paper after
such a measure? Law was removed from his office, and his
enemies proceeded to demolish the &ldquo;system.&rdquo; A vast number
of shares had been deposited in the bank. These were destroyed.
The notes were reconverted into government debt, but there
was first a <i>visa</i> which reduced that debt to the same size as before
it was taken over by the company. The rate of interest was
lowered, and the government now only pledged itself to pay
37 instead of 80 millions annually. Finally the bank was
abolished, and the company reduced to a mere trading association.
By November the &ldquo;system&rdquo; had disappeared. With
these last measures Law, it may well be believed, had nothing to
do. He left France secretly in December 1720, resumed his
wandering life, and died at Venice, poor and forgotten, on the
21st of March 1729.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Of Law&rsquo;s writings the most important for the comprehension of
the &ldquo;system&rdquo; is his <i>Money and Trade Considered</i>. In this work he
says that national power and wealth consist in numbers of people,
and magazines of home and foreign goods. These depend on trade,
and that on money, of which a greater quantity employs more
people; but credit, if the credit have a circulation, has all the
beneficial effects of money. To create and increase instruments of
credit is the function of a bank. Let such be created then, and let
its notes be only given in return for land sold or pledged. Such a
currency would supply the nation with abundance of money; and
it would have many advantages, which Law points out in detail,
over silver. The bank or commission was to be a government institution,
and its profits were to be spent in encouraging the export and
manufacture of the nation. A very evident error lies at the root
of the &ldquo;system.&rdquo; Money is not the result but the cause of wealth, he
thought. To increase it then must be beneficial, and the best way is
by a properly secured paper currency. This is the motive force; but
it is to be applied in a particular way. Law had a profound belief
in the omnipotence of government. He saw the evils of minor
monopolies, and of private farming of taxes. He proposed to centre
foreign trade and internal finance in one huge monopoly managed
by the state for the people, and carrying on business through a
plentiful supply of paper money. He did not see that trade and
commerce are best left to private enterprise, and that such a scheme
would simply result in the profits of speculators and favourites.
The &ldquo;system&rdquo; was never so far developed as to exhibit its inherent
faults. The madness of speculators ruined the plan when
only its foundations were laid. One part indeed might have been
saved. The bank was not necessarily bound to the company, and
had its note-issue been retrenched it might have become a permanent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>299</span>
institution. As Thiers points out, the edict of the 5th of March 1720,
which made the shares convertible into notes, ruined the bank
without saving the company. The shares had risen to an unnatural
height, and they should have been allowed to fall to their natural
level. Perhaps Law felt this to be impossible. He had friends at
court whose interests were involved in the shares, and he had enemies
eager for his overthrow. It was necessary to succeed completely or
not at all; so Law, a gambler to the core, risked and lost everything.
Notwithstanding the faults of the &ldquo;system,&rdquo; its author was a
financial genius of the first order. He had the errors of his time; but
he propounded many truths as to the nature of currency and banking
then unknown to his contemporaries. The marvellous skill which he
displayed in adapting the theory of the &ldquo;system&rdquo; to the actual condition
of things in France, and in carrying out the various financial
transactions rendered necessary by its development, is absolutely
without parallel. His profound self-confidence and belief in the
truth of his own theories were the reasons alike of his success and his
ruin. He never hesitated to employ the whole force of a despotic
government for the definite ends which he saw before him. He left
France poorer than he entered it, yet he was not perceptibly changed
by his sudden transitions of fortune. Montesquieu visited him at
Venice after his fall, and has left a description of him touched with
a certain pathos. Law, he tells us, was still the same in character,
perpetually planning and scheming, and, though in poverty, revolving
vast projects to restore himself to power, and France to
commercial prosperity.</p>

Certainly the suggestion of a central board, to manage great commercial
undertakings, to furnish occupation for the poor, to encourage
mining, fishing and manufactures, and to bring about a reduction in
the rate of interest, was largely realized in the Mississippi scheme.

<p><span class="bold">LAW, WILLIAM<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (1686-1761), English divine, was born at
King&rsquo;s Cliffe, Northamptonshire. In 1705 he entered as a sizar
at Emmanuel College, Cambridge; in 1711 he was elected fellow
of his college and was ordained. He resided at Cambridge,
teaching and taking occasional duty until the accession of
George I., when his conscience forbade him to take the oaths
of allegiance to the new government and of abjuration of the
Stuarts. His Jacobitism had already been betrayed in a tripos
speech which brought him into trouble; and he was now
deprived of his fellowship and became a non-juror. For the
next few years he is said to have been a curate in London. By
1727 he was domiciled with Edward Gibbon (1666-1736) at
Putney as tutor to his son Edward, father of the historian,
who says that Law became &ldquo;the much honoured friend and
spiritual director of the whole family.&rdquo; In the same year he
accompanied his pupil to Cambridge, and resided with him as
governor, in term time, for the next four years. His pupil then
went abroad, but Law was left at Putney, where he remained
in Gibbon&rsquo;s house for more than ten years, acting as a religious
guide not only to the family but to a number of earnest-minded
folk who came to consult him. The most eminent of these were
the two brothers John and Charles Wesley, John Byrom the
poet, George Cheyne the physician and Archibald Hutcheson,
M.P. for Hastings. The household was dispersed in 1737.
Law was parted from his friends, and in 1740 retired to King&rsquo;s
Cliffe, where he had inherited from his father a house and a small
property. There he was presently joined by two ladies: Mrs
Hutcheson, the rich widow of his old friend, who recommended
her on his death-bed to place herself under Law&rsquo;s spiritual
guidance, and Miss Hester Gibbon, sister to his late pupil.
This curious trio lived for twenty-one years a life wholly given
to devotion, study and charity, until the death of Law on the
9th of April 1761.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Law was a busy writer under three heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Controversy.</i>&mdash;In this field he had no contemporary peer save
perhaps Richard Bentley. The first of his controversial works was
<i>Three Letters to the Bishop of Bangor</i> (1717), which were considered by
friend and foe alike as one of the most powerful contributions to the
Bangorian controversy on the high church side. Thomas Sherlock
declared that &ldquo;Mr Law was a writer so considerable that he knew
but one good reason why his lordship did not answer him.&rdquo; Law&rsquo;s
next controversial work was <i>Remarks on Mandeville&rsquo;s Fable of the
Bees</i> (1723), in which he vindicates morality on the highest grounds;
for pure style, caustic wit and lucid argument this work is remarkable;
it was enthusiastically praised by John Sterling, and
republished by F. D. Maurice. Law&rsquo;s <i>Case of Reason</i> (1732), in
answer to Tindal&rsquo;s <i>Christianity as old as the Creation</i> is to a great
extent an anticipation of Bishop Butler&rsquo;s famous argument in the
<i>Analogy</i>. In this work Law shows himself at least the equal of the
ablest champion of Deism. His <i>Letters to a Lady inclined to enter the
Church of Rome</i> are excellent specimens of the attitude of a high
Anglican towards Romanism. His controversial writings have not
received due recognition, partly because they were opposed to the
drift of his times, partly because of his success in other fields.</p>

<p>2. <i>Practical Divinity.</i>&mdash;The <i>Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life</i>
(1728), together with its predecessor, <i>A Treatise of Christian Perfection</i>
(1726), deeply influenced the chief actors in the great
Evangelical revival. The Wesleys, George Whitefield, Henry Venn,
Thomas Scott and Thomas Adam all express their deep obligation
to the author. The <i>Serious Call</i> affected others quite as deeply.
Samuel Johnson, Gibbon, Lord Lyttelton and Bishop Horne all
spoke enthusiastically of its merits; and it is still the only work by
which its author is popularly known. It has high merits of style,
being lucid and pointed to a degree. In a tract entitled <i>The Absolute
Unlawfulness of Stage Entertainments</i> (1726) Law was tempted by the
corruptions of the stage of the period to use unreasonable language,
and incurred some effective criticism from John Dennis in <i>The Stage
Defended</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Mysticism.</i>&mdash;Though the least popular, by far the most interesting,
original and suggestive of all Law&rsquo;s works are those which he
wrote in his later years, after he had become an enthusiastic admirer
(not a disciple) of Jacob Boehme, the Teutonic theosophist. From
his earliest years he had been deeply impressed with the piety,
beauty and thoughtfulness of the writings of the Christian mystics,
but it was not till after his accidental meeting with the works of
Boehme, about 1734, that pronounced mysticism appeared in his
works. Law&rsquo;s mystic tendencies divorced him from the practical-minded
Wesley, but in spite of occasional wild fancies the books are
worth reading. They are <i>A Demonstration of the Gross and Fundamental
Errors of a late Book called a &ldquo;Plain Account, &amp;c., of the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper</i>&rdquo; (1737); <i>The Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Regeneration</i>
(1739); <i>An Appeal to all that Doubt and Disbelieve the Truths of
Revelation</i> (1740); <i>An Earnest and Serious Answer to Dr Trapp&rsquo;s
Sermon on being Righteous Overmuch</i> (1740); <i>The Spirit of Prayer</i>
(1749, 1752); <i>The Way to Divine Knowledge</i> (1752); <i>The Spirit of Love</i>
(1752, 1754); <i>A Short but Sufficient Confutation of Dr Warburton&rsquo;s
Projected Defence</i> (<i>as he calls it</i>) <i>of Christianity in his &ldquo;Divine Legation
of Moses&rdquo;</i> (1757); <i>A Series of Letters</i> (1760); a <i>Dialogue between a
Methodist and a Churchman</i> (1760); and <i>An Humble, Earnest and
Affectionate Address to the Clergy</i> (1761).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAW<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> (O. Eng. <i>lagu</i>, M. Eng. <i>lawe</i>; from an old Teutonic root
<i>lag</i>, &ldquo;lie,&rdquo; what lies fixed or evenly; cf. Lat. <i>lex</i>, Fr. <i>loi</i>), a word
used in English in two main senses&mdash;(1) as a rule prescribed by
authority for human action, and (2) in scientific and philosophic
phraseology, as a uniform order of sequence (<i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;laws&rdquo; of
motion). In the first sense the word is used either in the abstract,
for jurisprudence generally or for a state of things in which the
laws of a country are duly observed (&ldquo;law and order&rdquo;), or in the
concrete for some particular rule or body of rules. It is usual
to distinguish further between &ldquo;law&rdquo; and &ldquo;equity&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>).
The scientific and philosophic usage has grown out of an early
conception of jurisprudence, and is really metaphorical, derived
from the phrase &ldquo;natural law&rdquo; or &ldquo;law of nature,&rdquo; which
presumed that commands were laid on matter by God (see
T. E. Holland, <i>Elements of Jurisprudence</i>, ch. ii.). The adjective
&ldquo;legal&rdquo; is only used in the first sense, never in the second. In
the case of the &ldquo;moral law&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ethics</a></span>) the term is employed
somewhat ambiguously because of its connexion with both
meanings. There is also an Old English use of the word &ldquo;law&rdquo;
in a more or less sporting sense (&ldquo;to give law&rdquo; or &ldquo;allow so
much law&rdquo;), meaning a start or fair allowance in time or distance.
Presumably this originated simply in the liberty-loving Briton&rsquo;s
respect for proper legal procedure; instead of the brute exercise
of tyrannous force he demanded &ldquo;law,&rdquo; or a fair opportunity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>
and trial. But it may simply be an extension of the meaning
of &ldquo;right,&rdquo; or of the sense of &ldquo;leave&rdquo; which is found in early
uses of the French <i>loi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWES, HENRY<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (1595-1662), English musician, was born
at Dinton in Wiltshire in December 1595, and received his
musical education from John Cooper, better known under his
Italian pseudonym Giovanni Coperario (d. 1627), a famous
composer of the day. In 1626 he was received as one of the
gentlemen of the chapel royal, which place he held till the
Commonwealth put a stop to church music. But even during
that songless time Lawes continued his work as a composer, and
the famous collection of his vocal pieces, <i>Ayres and Dialogues for
One, Two and Three Voyces</i>, was published in 1653, being followed
by two other books under the same title in 1655 and 1658
respectively. When in 1660 the king returned, Lawes once
more entered the royal chapel, and composed an anthem for
the coronation of Charles II. He died on the 21st of October
1662, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Lawes&rsquo;s name
has become known beyond musical circles by his friendship with
Milton, whose <i>Comus</i> he supplied with incidental music for the
performance of the masque in 1634. The poet in return immortalized
his friend in the famous sonnet in which Milton,
with a musical perception not common amongst poets, exactly
indicates the great merit of Lawes. His careful attention to the
words of the poet, the manner in which his music seems to grow
from those words, the perfect coincidence of the musical with the
metrical accent, all put Lawes&rsquo;s songs on a level with those of
Schumann or Liszt or any modern composer. At the same time
he is by no means wanting in genuine melodic invention, and
his concerted music shows the learned contrapuntist.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWES, SIR JOHN BENNET,<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> <span class="sc">Bart.</span> (1814-1900), English
agriculturist, was born at Rothamsted on the 28th of December
1814. Even before leaving Oxford, where he matriculated
in 1832, he had begun to interest himself in growing various
medicinal plants on the Rothamsted estates, which he inherited
on his father&rsquo;s death in 1822. About 1837 he began to experiment
on the effects of various manures on plants growing in
pots, and a year or two later the experiments were extended to
crops in the field. One immediate consequence was that in
1842 he patented a manure formed by treating phosphates with
sulphuric acid, and thus initiated the artificial manure industry.
In the succeeding year he enlisted the services of Sir J. H.
Gilbert, with whom he carried on for more than half a century
those experiments in raising crops and feeding animals which
have rendered Rothamsted famous in the eyes of scientific
agriculturists all over the world (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Agriculture</a></span>). In 1854
he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, which in 1867
bestowed a Royal medal on Lawes and Gilbert jointly, and in
1882 he was created a baronet. In the year before his death,
which happened on the 31st of August 1900, he took measures
to ensure the continued existence of the Rothamsted experimental
farm by setting aside ¬£100,000 for that purpose and
constituting the Lawes Agricultural Trust, composed of four
members from the Royal Society, two from the Royal Agricultural
Society, one each from the Chemical and Linnaean
Societies, and the owner of Rothamsted mansion-house for the
time being.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAW MERCHANT<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Lex mercatoria</span>, originally a body
of rules and principles relating to merchants and mercantile
transactions, laid down by merchants themselves for the purpose
of regulating their dealings. It was composed of such usages
and customs as were common to merchants and traders in all
parts of Europe, varied slightly in different localities by special
peculiarities. The law merchant owed its origin to the fact that
the civil law was not sufficiently responsive to the growing
demands of commerce, as well as to the fact that trade in pre-medieval
times was practically in the hands of those who might
be termed cosmopolitan merchants, who wanted a prompt and
effective jurisdiction. It was administered for the most part in
special courts, such as those of the gilds in Italy, or the fair
courts of Germany and France, or as in England, in courts of
the staple or piepowder (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sea Laws</a></span>). The history of the
law merchant in England is divided into three stages: the first
prior to the time of Coke, when it was a special kind of law&mdash;as
distinct from the common law&mdash;administered in special courts
for a special class of the community (<i>i.e.</i> the mercantile); the
second stage was one of transition, the law merchant being
administered in the common law courts, but as a body of customs,
to be proved as a fact in each individual case of doubt; the
third stage, which has continued to the present day, dates from
the presidency over the king&rsquo;s bench of Lord Mansfield (<i>q.v.</i>),
under whom it was moulded into the mercantile law of to-day.
To the law merchant modern English law owes the fundamental
principles in the law of partnership, negotiable instruments and
trade marks.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWN,<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> a very thin fabric made from level linen or cotton
yarns. It is used for light dresses and trimmings, also for
handkerchiefs. The terms lawn and cambric (<i>q.v.</i>) are often
intended to indicate the same fabric. The word &ldquo;lawn&rdquo; was
formerly derived from the French name for the fabric <i>linon</i>,
from <i>lin</i>, flax, linen, but Skeat (<i>Etym. Dict.</i>, 1898, Addenda) and
A. Thomas (<i>Romania</i>, xxix. 182, 1900) have shown that the
real source of the word is to be found in the name of the French
town Laon. Skeat quotes from Palsgrave, <i>Les claircissement
de la langue Fran√ßo√øse</i> (1530), showing that the early name
of the fabric was <i>Laune lynen</i>. An early form of the word was
&ldquo;laund,&rdquo; probably due to an adaptation to &ldquo;laund,&rdquo; lawn,
glade or clearing in a forest, now used of a closely-mown expanse
of grass in a garden, park, &amp;c. (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Grass</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Horticulture</a></span>).
This word comes from O. Fr. <i>launde</i>, mod. <i>lande</i>, wild, heathy
or sandy ground, covered with scrub or brushwood, a word of
Celtic origin; cf. Irish and Breton <i>lann</i>, heathy ground, also
enclosure, land; Welsh <i>llan</i>, enclosure. It is cognate with
&ldquo;land,&rdquo; common to Teutonic languages. In the original sense
of clearing in a forest, glade, Lat. <i>saltus</i>, &ldquo;lawn,&rdquo; still survives
in the New Forest, where it is used of the feeding-places of
cattle.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWN-TENNIS,<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> a game played with racquet and ball on a
court traversed by a net, but without enclosing walls. It is a
modern adaptation of the ancient game of tennis (<i>q.v.</i>), with
which it is identical as regards the scoring of the game and
&ldquo;set.&rdquo; Lawn-tennis is essentially a summer game, played
in the open air, either on courts marked with whitewash on
close-cut grass like a cricket pitch, or on asphalt, cinders, gravel,
wood, earth or other substance which can be so prepared as to
afford a firm, level and smooth surface. In winter, however,
the game is often played on the floor of gymnasiums, drill sheds
or other buildings, when it is called &ldquo;covered-court lawn-tennis&rdquo;;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>301</span>
but there is no difference in the game itself corresponding to
these varieties of court.</p>

<p>The lawn-tennis court for the single-handed game, one player
against one (&ldquo;singles&rdquo;), is shown in fig. 1, and that for the
four-handed game (&ldquo;doubles&rdquo;) in fig. 2. The net stretched
across the middle of the court is attached to the tops of two
posts which stand 3 ft. outside the court on each side. The
height of the net is 3 ft. 6 in. at the posts and 3 ft. at the centre.
The court is
bisected longitudinally
by the
half-court-line,
which, however,
is marked only
between the
two service-lines
and at the
points of junction
with the
base-lines. The
divisions of the
court on each
side of the half-court-line
are
called respectively
the
right-hand and left-hand courts; and the portion of these
divisions between the service-lines and the net are the right-hand
service-court and left-hand service-court respectively.
The balls, which are made of hollow india-rubber, tightly covered
with white flannel, are 2¬Ω in. in diameter, and from 1<span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> to 2 oz.
in weight. The racquets (fig. 3), for which there are no regulation
dimensions, are broader and lighter than those used in tennis.</p>

<p>Before play begins, a racquet is spun as in tennis, and the
winner of the spin elects either to take
first service or to take choice of courts.
If he takes choice of courts, he and his
partner (if the game be doubles) take
their position on the selected side of the
net, one stationing himself in the right-hand
court and the other in the left,
which positions are retained throughout
the set. If the winner of the spin takes
choice of courts, his opponent has first
service; and vice versa. The players
change sides of the net at the end of the
first, third and every subsequent alternate
game, and at the end of each set;
but they may agree not to change during
any set except the last. Service is delivered
by each player in turn, who retains
it for one game irrespective of the winning
or losing of points. In doubles the
partner of the server in the first game
serves in the third, and the partner of
the server in the second game serves in
the fourth; the same order being preserved
till the end of the set; but each
pair of partners decide for themselves
before their first turn of service which
of the two shall serve first. The server
delivers the service from the right- and
left-hand courts alternately, beginning
in each of his service games from the right-hand court,
even though odds be given or owed; he must stand behind
(<i>i.e.</i> farther from the net than) the base-line, and must serve
the ball so that it drops in the opponent&rsquo;s service-court diagonally
opposite to the court served from, or upon one of the lines
enclosing that service-court. If in a serve, otherwise good, the
ball touches the net, it is a &ldquo;let&rdquo; whether the serve be &ldquo;taken&rdquo;
or not by striker-out; a &ldquo;let&rdquo; does not annul a previous
&ldquo;fault.&rdquo; (For the meaning of &ldquo;let,&rdquo; &ldquo;rest,&rdquo; &ldquo;striker-out&rdquo;
and other technical terms used in the game, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tennis</a></span> and
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Racquets</a></span>.) The serve is a fault (1) if it be not delivered by
the server from the proper court, and from behind the base-line;
(2) if the ball drops into the net or out-of-court, or into any part
of the court other than the proper service-court. The striker-out
cannot, as in racquets, &ldquo;take,&rdquo; and thereby condone, a
fault. When a fault has been served, the server must serve
again from the same court, unless it was a fault because served
from the wrong court, in which case the server crosses to the
proper court before serving again. Two consecutive faults
score a point against the side of the server. Lawn-tennis differs
from tennis and racquets in that the service may not be taken
on the volley by striker-out. After the serve has been returned
the play proceeds until the &ldquo;rest&rdquo; (or &ldquo;rally&rdquo;) ends by one
side or the other failing to make a &ldquo;good return&rdquo;; a good
return in lawn-tennis meaning a stroke by which the ball, having
been hit with the racquet before its second bound, is sent over
the net, even if it touches the net, so as to fall within the limits
of the court on the opposite side. A point is scored by the player,
or side, whose opponent fails to return the serve or to make
a good return in the rest. A player also loses a point if the ball
when in play touches him or his partner, or their clothes; or
if he or his racquet touches the net or any of its supports while
the ball is in play; or if he leaps over the net to avoid touching
it; or if he volley the ball before it has passed the net.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For him who would excel in lawn-tennis a strong fast service is
hardly less necessary than a heavily &ldquo;cut&rdquo; service to the tennis
player and the racquet player. High overhand service, by which
alone any great pace can be obtained, was first perfected by the
brothers Renshaw between 1880 and 1890, and is now universal
even among players far below the first rank. The service in vogue
among the best players in America, and from this circumstance
known as the &ldquo;American service,&rdquo; has less pace than the English
but is &ldquo;cut&rdquo; in such a way that it swerves in the air and &ldquo;drags&rdquo;
off the ground, the advantage being that it gives the server more
time to &ldquo;run in&rdquo; after his serve, so as to volley his opponent&rsquo;s
return from a position within a yard or two of the net. Both in
singles and doubles the best players often make it their aim to get
up comparatively near the net as soon as possible, whether they are
serving or receiving the serve, the object being to volley the ball
whenever possible before it begins to fall. The server&rsquo;s partner, in
doubles, stands about a yard and a half from the net, and rather
nearer the side-line than the half-court-line; the receiver of the
service, not being allowed to volley the serve, must take his stand
according to the nature of the service, which, if very fast, will require
him to stand outside the base-line; the receiver&rsquo;s partner usually
stands between the net and the service-line. All four players, if the
rest lasts beyond a stroke or two, are generally found nearer to the
net than the service-lines; and the game, assuming the players to
be of the championship class, consists chiefly of rapid low volleying,
varied by attempts on one side or the other to place the ball out of
the opponents&rsquo; reach by &ldquo;lobbing&rdquo; it over their heads into the back
part of the court. Good &ldquo;lobbing&rdquo; demands great skill, to avoid on
the one hand sending the ball out of court beyond the base-line, and
on the other allowing it to drop short enough for the adversary to
kill it with a &ldquo;smashing&rdquo; volley. Of &ldquo;lobbing&rdquo; it has been laid
down by the brothers Doherty that &ldquo;the higher it is the better, so
long as the length is good&rdquo;; and as regards returning lobs the same
authorities say, &ldquo;you must get them if you can before they drop,
for it is usually fatal to let them drop when playing against a good
pair.&rdquo; The reason for this is that if the lob be allowed to drop before
being returned, so much time is given to the striker of it to gain
position that he is almost certain to be able to kill the return, unless
the lob be returned by an equally good and very high lob, dropping
within a foot or so of the base-line in the opposite court, a stroke that
requires the utmost accuracy of strength to accomplish safely.
The game in the hands of first-class players consists largely in
man&oelig;uvring for favourable position in the court while driving the
opponent into a less favourable position on his side of the net; the
player who gains the advantage of position in this way being generally
able to finish the rest by a smashing volley impossible to return.
Ability to play this &ldquo;smash&rdquo; stroke is essential to strong lawn-tennis.
&ldquo;To be good overhead,&rdquo; say the Dohertys, &ldquo;is the sign of a
first-class player, even if a few have managed to get on without it.&rdquo;
The smash stroke is played very much in the same way as the overhand
service, except that it is not from a defined position of known
distance from the net; and therefore when making it the player
must realize almost instinctively what his precise position is in relation
to the net and the side-lines, for it is of the last importance
that he should not take his eye off the ball &ldquo;even for the hundredth
part of a second.&rdquo; By drawing the racquet across the ball at the
moment of impact spin may be imparted to it as in tennis, or as
&ldquo;side&rdquo; is imparted to a billiard ball, and the direction of this spin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span>
and the consequent behaviour of the ball after the stroke may be
greatly varied by a skilful player. Perhaps the most generally useful
form of spin, though by no means the only one commonly used, is
that known as &ldquo;top&rdquo; or &ldquo;lift,&rdquo; a vertical rotatory motion of the
ball in the same direction as its flight, which is imparted to it by an
upward draw of the racquet at the moment of making the stroke,
and the effect of which is to make it drop more suddenly than it
would ordinarily do, and in an unexpected curve. A drive made
with plenty of &ldquo;top&rdquo; can be hit much harder than would otherwise
be possible without sending the ball out of court, and it is therefore
extensively employed by the best players. While the volleying
game is almost universally the practice of first-class players&mdash;A. W.
Gore, M. J. G. Ritchie and S. H. Smith being almost alone among
those of championship rank in modern days to use the volley comparatively
little&mdash;its difficulty places it beyond the reach of the less
skilful. In lawn-tennis as played at the ordinary country house or
local club the real &ldquo;smash&rdquo; of a Renshaw or a Doherty is seldom to
be seen, and the high lob is almost equally rare. Players of moderate
calibre are content to take the ball on the bound and to return it with
some pace along the side-lines or across the court, with the aim of
placing it as artfully as possible beyond the reach of the adversary;
and if now and again they venture to imitate a stroke employed
with killing effect at Wimbledon, they think themselves fortunate if
they occasionally succeed in making it without disaster to themselves.</p>

<p>Before 1890 the method of handicapping at lawn-tennis was the
same as in tennis so far as it was applicable to a game played in an
open court. In 1890 bisques were abolished, and in 1894 an elaborate
system was introduced by which fractional parts of &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; could
be conceded by way of handicap, in accordance with tables inserted
in the laws of the game. The system is a development of the tennis
handicapping by which a finer graduation of odds may be given.
&ldquo;One-sixth of fifteen&rdquo; is one stroke given in every six games of a
set; and similarly two-sixths, three-sixths, four-sixths and five-sixths
of fifteen, are respectively two, three, four and five strokes given
in every six games of a set; the particular game in the set in which
the stroke in each case must be given being specified in the tables.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Lawn-tennis cannot be said to have existed prior
to the year 1874. It is, indeed, true that outdoor games based
on tennis were from time to time improvised by lovers of that
game who found themselves out of reach of a tennis-court. Lord
Arthur Hervey, sometime bishop of Bath and Wells, had thus
devised a game which he and his friends played on the lawn
of his rectory in Suffolk; and even so early as the end of the
18th century &ldquo;field tennis&rdquo; was mentioned by the <i>Sporting
Magazine</i> as a game that rivalled the popularity of cricket.
But, however much or little this game may have resembled
lawn-tennis, it had long ceased to exist; and even to be remembered,
when in 1874 Major Wingfield took out a patent for a
game called Sphairistike, which the specification described as
&ldquo;a new and improved portable court for playing the ancient
game of tennis.&rdquo; The court for this game was wider at the base-lines
than at the net, giving the whole court the shape of an
hour-glass; one side of the net only was divided into service-courts,
service being always delivered from a fixed mark in the
centre of the opposite court; and from the net-posts side-nets
were fixed which tapered down to the ground at about the middle
of the side-lines, thus enclosing nearly half the courts on each
side of the net. The possibilities of Sphairistike were quickly
perceived; and under the new name of lawn-tennis its popularity
grew so quickly that in 1875 a meeting of those interested in
the game was held at Lord&rsquo;s cricket-ground, where a committee
of the Marylebone Club (M.C.C.) was appointed to draw up a
code of rules. The hour-glass shape of the court was retained
by this code (issued in May 1875), and the scoring of the game
followed in the main the racquets instead of the tennis model.
It was at the suggestion of J. M. Heathcote, the amateur tennis
champion, that balls covered with white flannel were substituted
for the uncovered balls used at first. In 1875, through
the influence of Henry Jones (&ldquo;Cavendish&rdquo;), lawn-tennis was
included in the programme of the All England Croquet Club,
which in 1877 became the All England Croquet and Lawn-Tennis
Club, on whose ground at Wimbledon the All England
championships have been annually played since that date.
In the same year, in anticipation of the first championship
meeting, the club appointed a committee consisting of Henry
Jones, Julian Marshall and C. G. Heathcote to revise the M.C.C.
code of rules; the result of their labours being the introduction
of the tennis in place of the racquets scoring, the substitution
of a rectangular for the &ldquo;hour-glass&rdquo; court, and the enactment
of the modern rule as regards the &ldquo;fault.&rdquo; The height of the
net, which under the M.C.C. rules had been 4 ft. in the centre,
was reduced to 3 ft. 3 in.; and regulations as to the size and
weight of the ball were also made. Some controversy had
already taken place in the columns of the <i>Field</i> as to whether
volleying the ball, at all events within a certain distance of the
net, should not be prohibited. Spencer Gore, the first to win
the championship in 1877, used the volley with great skill and
judgment, and in principle anticipated the tactics afterwards
brought to perfection by the Renshaws, which aimed at forcing
the adversary back to the base-line and killing his return with
a volley from a position near the net. P. F. Hadow, champion
in 1878, showed how the volley might be defeated by skilful
use of the lob; but the question of placing some check on the
volley continued to be agitated among lovers of the game. The
rapidly growing popularity of lawn-tennis was proved in 1879
by the inauguration at Oxford of the four-handed championship,
and at Dublin of the Irish championship, and by the fact that
there were forty-five competitors for the All England single
championship at Wimbledon, won by J. T. Hartley, a player
who chiefly relied on the accuracy of his return without frequent
resort to the volley. It was in the autumn of the same year,
in a tournament at Cheltenham, that W. Renshaw made his
first successful appearance in public. The year 1880 saw the
foundation of the Northern Lawn-Tennis Association, whose
tournaments have long been regarded as inferior in importance
only to the championship meetings at Wimbledon and Dublin,
and a revision of the rules which substantially made them what
they have ever since remained. This year is also memorable
for the first championship doubles won by the twin brothers
William and Ernest Renshaw, a success which the former followed
up by winning the Irish championship, beating among others
H. F. Lawford for the first time.</p>

<p>The Renshaws had already developed the volleying game at the
net, and had shown what could be done with the &ldquo;smash&rdquo;
stroke (which became known by their name as the &ldquo;Renshaw
smash&rdquo;), but their service had not as yet become very severe.
In 1881 the distinctive features of their style were more marked,
and the brothers first established firmly the supremacy which
they maintained almost without interruption for the next eight
years. In the doubles they discarded the older tactics of one
partner standing back and the other near the net; the two
Renshaws stood about the same level, just inside the service-line,
and from there volleyed with relentless severity and with
an accuracy never before equalled, and seldom if ever since;
while their service also acquired an immense increase of pace.
Their chief rival, and the leading exponent of the non-volleying
game for several years, was H. F. Lawford. After a year or two
it became evident that neither the volleying tactics of Renshaw
nor the strong back play of Lawford would be adopted to the
exclusion of the other, and both players began to combine the
two styles. Thus the permanent features of lawn-tennis may be
said to have been firmly established by about the year 1885;
and the players who have since then come to the front have for
the most part followed the principles laid down by the Renshaws
and Lawford. One of the greatest performances at lawn-tennis
was in the championship competition in 1886 when W. Renshaw
beat Lawford a love set in 9¬Ω minutes. The longest rest in first-class
lawn-tennis occurred in a match between Lawford and
E. Lubbock in 1880, when eighty-one strokes were played.
Among players in the first class who were contemporaries of
the Renshaws, mention should be made of E. de S. Browne, a
powerful imitator of the Renshaw style; C. W. Grinstead,
R. T. Richardson, V. Goold (who played under the <i>nom de plume</i>
&ldquo;St Leger&rdquo;), J. T. Hartley, E. W. Lewis, E. L. Williams,
H. Grove and W. J. Hamilton; while among the most prominent
lady players of the period were Miss M. Langrishe, Miss Bradley,
Miss Maud Watson, Miss L. Dod, Miss Martin and Miss Bingley
(afterwards Mrs Hillyard). In 1888 the Lawn-Tennis Association
was established; and the All England Mixed Doubles Championship
(four-handed matches for ladies and gentlemen in partnership)
was added to the existing annual competitions. Since 1881
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>303</span>
lawn-tennis matches between Oxford and Cambridge universities
have been played annually; and almost every county in
England, besides Scotland, Wales and districts such as &ldquo;Midland
Counties,&rdquo; &ldquo;South of England,&rdquo; &amp;c., have their own championship
meetings. Tournaments are also played in winter at Nice,
Monte Carlo and other Mediterranean resorts where most of the
competitors are English visitors.</p>

<p>In the United States lawn-tennis was played at Nahant,
near Boston, within a year of its invention in England, Dr
James Dwight and the brothers F. R. and R. D. Sears being
mainly instrumental in making it known to their countrymen.
In 1881 at a meeting in New York of representatives of thirty-three
clubs the United States National Lawn-Tennis Association
was formed; and the adoption of the English rules put an end
to the absence of uniformity in the size of the ball and height
of the net which had hindered the progress of the game. The
association decided to hold matches for championship of the
United States at Newport, Rhode Island; and, by a curious
coincidence, in the same year in which W. Renshaw first won
the English championship, R. D. Sears won the first American
championship by playing a volleying game at the net which
entirely disconcerted his opponents, and he successfully defended
his title for the next six years, winning the doubles throughout
the same period in partnership with Dwight. In 1887, Sears
being unable to play through ill-health, the championship went
to H. W. Slocum. Other prominent players of the period were
the brothers C. M. and J. S. Clark, who in 1883 came to England
and were decisively beaten at Wimbledon by the two Renshaws.
To a later generation belong the strongest single players, M. D.
Whitman, Holcombe Ward, W. A. Larned and Karl Behr.
Holcombe Ward and Dwight Davis, who have the credit of introducing
the peculiar &ldquo;American twist service,&rdquo; were an exceedingly
strong pair in doubles; but after winning the American
doubles championship for three years in succession, they were
defeated in 1902 by the English brothers R. F. and H. L.
Doherty. The championship singles in 1904 and 1905 was won
by H. Ward and B. C. Wright, the latter being one of the finest
players America has produced; and these two in partnership
won the doubles for three years in succession, until they were
displaced by F. B. Alexander and H. H. Hackett, who in
their turn held the doubles championship for a like period.
In 1909 two young Californians, Long and McLoughlin, unexpectedly
came to the front, and, although beaten in the final
round for the championship doubles, they represented the
United States in the contest for the Davis cup (see below)
in Australia in that year; McLoughlin having acquired a
service of extraordinary power and a smashing stroke with
a reverse spin which was sufficient by itself to place him in
the highest rank of lawn-tennis players.</p>

<p>In 1900 an international challenge cup was presented by the
American D. F. Davis, to be competed for in the country of the
holders. In the summer of that year a British team, consisting
of A. W. Gore, E. D. Black and H. R. Barrett, challenged for the
cup but were defeated by the Americans, Whitman, Larned,
Davis and Ward. In 1902 a more representative British team,
the two Dohertys and Pim, were again defeated by the same
representatives of the United States; but in the following
year the Dohertys brought the Davis cup to England by beating
Larned and the brothers Wrenn at Longwood. In 1904 the cup
was played for at Wimbledon, when representatives of Belgium,
Austria and France entered, but failed to defeat the Dohertys
and F. L. Riseley, who represented Great Britain. In 1905 the
entries included France, Austria, Australasia, Belgium and the
United States; in 1906 the same countries, except Belgium,
competed; but in both years the British players withstood the
attack. In 1907, however, when the contest was confined to
England, the United States and Australasia, the latter was successful
in winning the cup, which was then for the first time taken
to the colonies, where it was retained in the following year
when the Australians N. E. Brookes and A. F. Wilding defeated
the representatives of the United States, who had previously
beaten the English challengers in America. In 1909 England
was not represented in the competition, and the Australians again
retained the cup, beating the Americans McLoughlin and Long
both in singles and doubles.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWRENCE<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Laurentius, Lorenzo</span>), <span class="bold">ST,</span> Christian martyr,
whose name appears in the canon of the mass, and whose festival
is on the 10th of August. The basilica reared over his tomb at
Rome is still visited by pilgrims. His legend is very popular.
Deacon of the pope (St) Sixtus (Xystus) II., he was called upon
by the judge to bring forth the treasures of the church which
had been committed to his keeping. He thereupon produced
the church&rsquo;s poor people. Seeing his bishop, Sixtus, being led
to punishment, he cried: &ldquo;Father! whither goest thou without
thy son? Holy priest! whither goest thou without thy deacon?&rdquo;
Sixtus prophesied that Lawrence would follow him in three days.
The prophecy was fulfilled, and Lawrence was sentenced to be
burnt alive on a gridiron. In the midst of his torments he
addressed the judge ironically with the words: <i>Assum est,
versa et manduca</i> (&ldquo;I am roasted enough on this side; turn me
round, and eat&rdquo;). All these details of the well-known legend
are already related by St Ambrose (<i>De Offic.</i> i. 41, ii. 28). The
punishment of the gridiron and the speech of the martyr are
probably a reminiscence of the Phrygian martyrs, as related
by Socrates (iii. 15) and Sozomen (v. 11). But the fact of the
martyrdom is unquestionable. The date is usually put at the
persecution of Valerian in 258.</p>

<p>The cult of St Lawrence has spread throughout Christendom,
and there are numerous churches dedicated to him, especially in
England, where 228 have been counted. The Escurial was built
in honour of St Lawrence by Philip II. of Spain, in memory of
the battle of St Quentin, which was won in 1557 on the day
of the martyr&rsquo;s festival. The meteorites which appear annually
on or about the 10th of August are popularly known as &ldquo;the
tears of St Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWRENCE, AMOS<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> (1786-1852), American merchant and
philanthropist, was born in Groton, Massachusetts, U.S.A., on
the 22nd of April 1786, a descendant of John Lawrence of Wisset,
Suffolk, England, who was one of the first settlers of Groton.
Leaving Groton academy (founded by his father, Samuel
Lawrence, and others) in 1799, he became a clerk in a country
store in Groton, whence after his apprenticeship he went, with
$20 in his pocket, to Boston and there set up in business for
himself in December 1807. In the next year he took into his
employ his brother, Abbott (see below), whom he made his
partner in 1814, the firm name being at first A. &amp; A. Lawrence,
and afterwards A. &amp; A. Lawrence &amp; Co. In 1831 when his
health failed, Amos Lawrence retired from active business,
and Abbott Lawrence was thereafter the head of the firm.
The firm became the greatest American mercantile house of the
day, was successful even in the hard times of 1812-1815, afterwards
engaged particularly in selling woollen and cotton goods
on commission, and did much for the establishment of the
cotton textile industry in New England: in 1830 by coming
to the aid of the financially distressed mills of Lowell, Massachusetts,
where in that year the Suffolk, Tremont and Lawrence
companies were established, and where Luther Lawrence, the
eldest brother, represented the firm&rsquo;s interests; and in 1845-1847
by establishing and building up Lawrence, Massachusetts,
named in honour of Abbott Lawrence, who was a director of the
Essex company, which controlled the water power of Lawrence,
and afterwards was president of the Atlantic Cotton Mills and
Pacific Mills there. In 1842 Amos Lawrence decided not to
allow his property to increase any further, and in the last eleven
years of his life he spent in charity at least $525,000, a large sum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span>
in those days. He gave to Williams college, to Bowdoin college,
to the Bangor theological seminary, to Wabash college, to
Kenyon college and to Groton academy, which was re-named
Lawrence academy in honour of the family, and especially in
recognition of the gifts of William Lawrence, Amos&rsquo;s brother;
to the Boston children&rsquo;s infirmary, which he established, and
($10,000) to the Bunker Hill monument fund; and, besides,
he gave to many good causes on a smaller scale, taking especial
delight in giving books, occasionally from a bundle of books in
his sleigh or carriage as he drove. He died in Boston on the
31st of December 1852.</p>

Lawrence, with a Brief Account of Some Incidents in his Life</i> (Boston,

</div>

<p>His brother, <span class="sc">Abbott Lawrence</span> (1792-1855), was born in
Groton, Massachusetts, on the 16th of December 1792. Besides
being a partner in the firm established by his brother, and long
its head, he promoted various New England railways, notably
the Boston &amp; Albany. He was a Whig representative in Congress
in 1835-1837 and in 1839-1840 (resigning in September 1840
because of ill-health); and in 1842 was one of the commissioners
for Massachusetts, who with commissioners from Maine and with
Daniel Webster, secretary of state and plenipotentiary of the
United States, settled with Lord Ashburton, the British plenipotentiary,
the question of the north-eastern boundary. In
1842 he was presiding officer in the Massachusetts Whig convention;
he broke with President Tyler, tacitly rebuked Daniel
Webster for remaining in Tyler&rsquo;s cabinet after his colleagues had
resigned, and recommended Henry Clay and John Davis as the
nominees of the Whig party in 1844&mdash;an action that aroused
Webster to make his famous Faneuil Hall address. In 1848
Lawrence was a prominent candidate for the Whig nomination for
the vice-presidency, but was defeated by Webster&rsquo;s followers.
He refused the portfolios of the navy and of the interior in
President Taylor&rsquo;s cabinet, and in 1849-1852 was United States
minister to Great Britain, where he was greatly aided by his
wealth and his generous hospitality. He was an ardent protectionist,
and represented Massachusetts at the Harrisburg
convention in 1827. He died in Boston on the 18th of August
1855, leaving as his greatest memorial the Lawrence scientific
school of Harvard university, which he had established by a
gift of $50,000 in 1847 and to which he bequeathed another
$50,000; in 1907-1908 this school was practically abolished as
a distinct department of the university. He made large gifts
to the Boston public library, and he left $50,000 for the erection
of model lodging-houses, thus carrying on the work of an Association
for building model lodging-houses for the poor, organized
in Boston in 1857.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWRENCE, AMOS ADAMS<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> (1814-1886), American philanthropist,
son of Amos Lawrence, was born in Groton, Massachusetts,
U.S.A., on the 31st of July 1814. He graduated at
Harvard in 1835, went into business in Lowell, and in 1837
established in Boston his own counting-house, which from 1843
to 1858 was the firm of Lawrence &amp; Mason, and which was a
selling agent for the Cocheco mills of Dover, New Hampshire,
and for other textile factories. Lawrence established a hosiery
and knitting mill at Ipswich&mdash;the first of importance in the
country&mdash;and was a director in many large corporations. He
was greatly interested in the claims of Eleazer Williams of Green
Bay, Wisconsin, and through loans to this &ldquo;lost dauphin&rdquo;
came into possession of much land in Wisconsin; in 1849 he
founded at Appleton, Wisconsin, a school named in his honour
Lawrence university (now Lawrence college). He also contributed
to funds for the colonization of free negroes in Liberia.
In 1854 he became treasurer of the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid
Company (reorganized in 1855 as the New England Emigrant
Aid Company), which sent 1300 settlers to Kansas, where the
city of Lawrence was named in his honour. He contributed
personally for the famous Sharp rifles, which, packed as &ldquo;books&rdquo;
and &ldquo;primers,&rdquo; were shipped to Kansas and afterwards came
into the hands of John Brown, who had been a <i>prot√©g√©</i> of Lawrence.
During the contest in Kansas, Lawrence wrote frequently
to President Pierce (his mother&rsquo;s nephew) in behalf of the free-state
settlers; and when John Brown was arrested he appealed
to the governor of Virginia to secure for him a lawful trial. On
Robinson and others in Kansas he repeatedly urged the necessity
of offering no armed resistance to the Federal government; and
he deplored Brown&rsquo;s fanaticism. In 1858 and in 1860 he was
the Whig candidate for governor of Massachusetts. Till the
very outbreak of the Civil War he was a &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; man,
and he did his best to secure the adoption of the Crittenden
compromise; but he took an active part in drilling troops,
and in 1862 he raised a battalion of cavalry which became the
2nd Massachusetts Regiment of Cavalry, of which Charles Russell
Lowell was colonel. Lawrence was a member of the Protestant
Episcopal Church and built (1873-1880) Lawrence hall, Cambridge,
for the Episcopal theological school, of which he was
treasurer. In 1857-1862 he was treasurer of Harvard college,
and in 1879-1885 was an overseer. He died in Nahant, Mass.,
on the 22nd of August 1886.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">William Lawrence</span> (1850-&emsp;&emsp;), graduated in 1871
at Harvard, and in 1875 at the Episcopal theological school,
where, after being rector of Grace Church, Lawrence, Mass.,
in 1876-1884, he was professor of homiletics and natural
theology in 1884-1893 and dean in 1888-1893. In 1893 he
succeeded Phillips Brooks as Protestant Episcopal bishop of
Massachusetts. He wrote <i>A Life of Roger Wolcott, Governor of

<p><span class="bold">LAWRENCE, GEORGE ALFRED<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> (1827-1876), English novelist,
was born at Braxted, Essex, on the 25th of March 1827,
and was educated at Rugby and at Balliol college, Oxford. He
was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1852, but soon
abandoned the law for literature. In 1857 he published, anonymously,
his first novel, <i>Guy Livingstone, or Thorough</i>. The book
achieved a very large sale, and had nine or ten successors of a
similar type, the best perhaps being <i>Sword and Gown</i> (1859).
Lawrence may be regarded as the originator in English fiction
of the <i>beau sabreur</i> type of hero, great in sport and love and war.
He died at Edinburgh on the 23rd of September 1876.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWRENCE, SIR HENRY MONTGOMERY<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (1806-1857),
British soldier and statesman in India, brother of the 1st Lord
Lawrence (<i>q.v.</i>), was born at Matara, Ceylon, on the 28th of June
1806. He inherited his father&rsquo;s stern devotion to duty and
Celtic impulsiveness, tempered by his mother&rsquo;s gentleness and
power of organization. Early in 1823 he joined the Bengal
Artillery at the Calcutta suburb of Dum Dum, where also
Henry Havelock was stationed about the same time. The
two officers pursued a very similar career, and developed the
same Puritan character up to the time that both died at Lucknow
in 1857. In the first Burmese War Henry Lawrence and his
battery formed part of the Chittagong column which General
Morrison led over the jungle-covered hills of Arakan, till fever
decimated the officers and men, and Lawrence found himself
at home again, wasted by a disease which never left him. On
his return to India with his younger brother John in 1829 he
was appointed revenue surveyor by Lord William Bentinck.
At Gorakhpur the wonderful personal influence which radiated
from the young officer formed a school of attached friends and
subordinates who were always eager to serve under him. After
some years spent in camp, during which he had married his
cousin Honoria Marshall, and had surveyed every village in
four districts, each larger than Yorkshire, he was recalled to a
brigade by the outbreak of the first Afghan War towards the
close of 1838. As assistant to Sir George Clerk, he now added
to his knowledge of the people political experience in the management
of the district of Ferozepore; and when disaster came
he was sent to Peshawar in order to push up supports for the
relief of Sale and the garrison of Jalalabad. The war had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>306</span>
begun under the tripartite treaty signed at Lahore on the 20th
of June 1838. But the Sikhs were slow to play their part after
the calamities in Afghanistan. No one but Henry Lawrence
could manage the disorderly contingent which they reluctantly
supplied to Pollock&rsquo;s avenging army in 1842. He helped to
force the Khyber Pass on the 5th of April, playing his guns
from the heights, for 8 and 20 m. In recognition of his services
Lord Ellenborough appointed him to the charge of the valley
of Dehra Dun and its hill stations, Mussoorie and Landour,
where he first formed the idea of asylums for the children of
European soldiers. After a month&rsquo;s experience there it was
discovered that the appointment, was the legal right of the
civil service, and he was transferred, as assistant to the envoy
at Lahore, to Umballa, where he reduced to order the lapsed
territory of Kaithal. Soon he received the office of resident at
the protected court of Nepal, where, assisted by his wife, he began
a series of contributions to the <i>Calcutta Review</i>, a selected
volume of which forms an Anglo-Indian classic. There, too,
he elaborated his plans which resulted in the erection and
endowment of the noblest philanthropic establishments in the
East&mdash;the Lawrence military asylums at Sanawar (on the road
to Simla), at Murree in the Punjab, at Mount Abu in Rajputana,
and at Lovedale on the Madras Nilgiris. From 1844 to his
death he devoted all his income, above a modest pittance for
his children, to this and other forms of charity.</p>

<p>The <i>Review</i> articles led the new governor-general, Lord
Hardinge, to summon Lawrence to his side during the first
Sikh War; and not these articles only. He had published the
results of his experience of Sikh rule and soldiering in a vivid
work, the <i>Adventures of an Officer in the Service of Ranjit Singh</i>
(1845), in which he vainly attempted to disguise his own personality
and exploits. After the doubtful triumphs of Moodkee
and Ferozshah Lawrence was summoned from Nepal to take
the place of Major George Broadfoot, who had fallen. Aliwal
came; then the guns of Sobraon chased the demoralized Sikhs
across the Sutlej. All through the smoke Lawrence was at the
side of the governor-general. He gave his voice, not for the
rescue of the people from anarchy by annexation, but for the
reconstruction of the Sikh government, and was himself appointed
resident at Lahore, with power &ldquo;over every department and
to any extent&rdquo; as president of the council of regency till the
maharaja Dhuleep Singh should come of age. Soon disgusted
by the &ldquo;venal and selfish durbar&rdquo; who formed his Sikh colleagues,
he summoned to his side assistants like Nicholson, James Abbott
and Edwardes, till they all did too much for the people, as he
regretfully confessed. But &ldquo;my chief confidence was in my
brother John, ... who gave me always such help as only a brother
could.&rdquo; Wearied out he went home with Lord Hardinge, and
was made K.C.B., when the second Sikh War summoned him
back at the end of 1848 to see the whole edifice of Sikh &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo;
collapse. It fell to Lord Dalhousie to proclaim the
Punjab up to the Khyber British territory on the 29th of March
1849. But still another compromise was tried. As the best
man to reconcile the Sikh chiefs to the inevitable, Henry Lawrence
was made president of the new board of administration with
charge of the political duties, and his brother John was entrusted
with the finances. John could not find the revenue necessary
for the rapid civilization of the new province so long as Henry
would, for political reasons, insist on granting life pensions and
alienating large estates to the needy remnants of Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s
court. Lord Dalhousie delicately but firmly removed Sir Henry
Lawrence to the charge of the great nobles of Rajputana, and
installed John as chief commissioner. If resentment burned
in Henry&rsquo;s heart, it was not against his younger brother, who
would fain have retired. To him he said, &ldquo;If you preserve the
peace of the country and make the people high and low happy,
I shall have no regrets that I vacated the field for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the comparative rest of Rajputana he once more took up
the pen as an army reformer. In March and September 1856
he published two articles, called forth by conversations with
Lord Dalhousie at Calcutta, whither he had gone as the hero
of a public banquet. The governor-general had vainly warned
the home authorities against reducing below 40,000 the British
garrison of India even for the Crimean War, and had sought to
improve the position of the sepoys. Lawrence pointed out the
latent causes of mutiny, and uttered warnings to be too soon
justified. In March 1857 he yielded to Lord Canning&rsquo;s request
that he should then take the helm at Lucknow, but it was too
late. In ten days his magic rule put down administrative
difficulties indeed, as he had done at Lahore. But what could
even he effect with only 700 European soldiers, when the epidemic
spread after the Meerut outbreak of mutiny on the 10th of May?
In one week he had completed those preparations which made
the defence of the Lucknow residency for ever memorable.
Amid the deepening gloom Lord Canning ever wrote home of
him as &ldquo;a tower of strength,&rdquo; and he was appointed provisional
governor-general. On the 30th of May mutiny burst forth in
Oudh, and he was ready. On the 29th of June, pressed by
fretful colleagues, and wasted by unceasing toil, he led 336
British soldiers with 11 guns and 220 natives out of Chinhat
to reconnoitre the insurgents, when the natives joined the
enemy and the residency was besieged. On the 2nd of July, as
he lay exhausted by the day&rsquo;s work and the terrific heat in an
exposed room, a shell struck him, and in forty-eight hours he
was no more. A baronetcy was conferred on his son. A marble
statue was placed in St Paul&rsquo;s as the national memorial of one
who has been declared to be the noblest man that has lived and
died for the good of India.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWRENCE, JOHN LAIRD MAIR LAWRENCE,<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Baron</span>
(1811-1879), viceroy and governor-general of India, was born
at Richmond, Yorkshire, on the 24th of March 1811. His father,
Colonel Alexander Lawrence, volunteered for the forlorn hope
at Seringapatam in presence of Baird and of Wellington, whose
friend he became. His mother, Letitia Knox, was a collateral
descendant of John Knox. To this couple were born twelve
children, of whom three became famous in India, Sir George
St Patrick, Sir Henry (<i>q.v.</i>) and Lord Lawrence. Irish Protestants,
the boys were trained at Foyle college, Derry, and at
Clifton, and received Indian appointments from their mother&rsquo;s
cousin, John Hudleston, who had been the friend of Schwartz
in Tanjore. In 1829, when only seventeen, John Lawrence
landed at Calcutta as a civilian; he mastered the Persian
language at the college of Fort William, and was sent to Delhi,
on his own application, as assistant to the collector. The position
was the most dangerous and difficult to which a Bengal civilian
could be appointed at that time. The titular court of the pensioner
who represented the Great Mogul was the centre of that
disaffection and sensuality which found their opportunity in
1857. A Mussulman rabble filled the city. The district around,
stretching from the desert of Rajputana to the Jumna, was
slowly recovering from the anarchy to which Lord Lake had
given the first blow. When not administering justice in the city
courts or under the village tree, John Lawrence was scouring
the country after the marauding Meos and Mahommedan freebooters.
His keen insight and sleepless energy at once detected
the murderer of his official superior, William Fraser, in 1835,
in the person of Shams-uddin Khan, the nawab of Loharu,
whose father had been raised to the principality by Lake, and
the assassin was executed. The first twenty years, from 1829
to 1849, during which John Lawrence acted as the magistrate
and land revenue collector of the most turbulent and backward
portion of the Indian empire as it then was, formed the period
of the reforms of Lord William Bentinck. To what became
the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western (now part
of the United) Provinces Lord Wellesley had promised the same
permanent settlement of the land-tax which Lord Cornwallis
had made with the large landholders or zemindars of Bengal.
The court of directors, going to the opposite extreme, had
sanctioned leases for only five years, so that agricultural progress
was arrested. In 1833 Merttins Bird and James Thomason
introduced the system of thirty years&rsquo; leases based on a careful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>307</span>
survey of every estate by trained civilians, and on the mapping
of every village holding by native subordinates. These two
revenue officers created a school of enthusiastic economists who
rapidly registered and assessed an area as large as that of Great
Britain, with a rural population of twenty-three millions. Of
that school John Lawrence proved the most ardent and the most
renowned. Intermitting his work at Delhi, he became land
revenue settlement officer in the district of Etawah, and there
began, by buying out or getting rid of the talukdars, to realize
the ideal which he did much to create throughout the rest of
his career&mdash;a country &ldquo;thickly cultivated by a fat contented
yeomanry, each man riding his own horse, sitting under his own
fig-tree, and enjoying his rude family comforts.&rdquo; This and a
quiet persistent hostility to the oppression of the people by their
chiefs formed the two features of his administrative policy
throughout life.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for the British power that, when the first
Sikh War broke out, John Lawrence was still collector of Delhi.
The critical engagements at Ferozeshah, following Moodkee,
and hardly redeemed by Aliwal, left the British army somewhat
exhausted at the gate of the Punjab, in front of the Sikh entrenchments
on the Sutlej. For the first seven weeks of 1846
there poured into camp, day by day, the supplies and munitions
of war which this one man raised and pushed forward, with
all the influence acquired during fifteen years of an iron yet
sympathetic rule in the land between the Jumna and the Sutlej.
The crowning victory of Sobraon was the result, and at thirty-five
Lawrence became commissioner of the Jullundur Doab, the
fertile belt of hill and dale stretching from the Sutlej north to
the Indus. The still youthful civilian did for the newly annexed
territory what he had long before accomplished in and around
Delhi. He restored it to order, without one regular soldier.
By the fascination of his personal influence he organized levies
of the Sikhs who had just been defeated, led them now against
a chief in the upper hills and now to storm the fort of a raja in
the lower, till he so welded the people into a loyal mass that
he was ready to repeat the service of 1846 when, three years
after, the second Sikh War ended in the conversion of the Punjab
up to Peshawar into a British province.</p>

<p>Lord Dalhousie had to devise a government for a warlike
population now numbering twenty-three millions, and covering
an area little less than that of the United Kingdom. The first
results were not hopeful; and it was not till John Lawrence
became chief commissioner, and stood alone face to face with
the chiefs and people and ring fence of still untamed border
tribes, that there became possible the most successful experiment
in the art of civilizing turbulent millions which history
presents. The province was mapped out into districts, now
numbering thirty-two, in addition to thirty-six tributary states,
small and great. To each the thirty years&rsquo; leases of the north-west
settlement were applied, after a patient survey and assessment
by skilled officials ever in the saddle or the tent. The
revenue was raised on principles so fair to the peasantry that
Ranjit Singh&rsquo;s exactions were reduced by a fourth, while agricultural
improvements were encouraged. For the first time
in its history since the earliest Aryan settlers had been overwhelmed
by successive waves of invaders, the soil of the Punjab
came to have a marketable value, which every year of British
rule has increased. A stalwart police was organized; roads
were cut through every district, and canals were constructed.
Commerce followed on increasing cultivation and communications,
courts brought justice to every man&rsquo;s door, and crime hid
its head. The adventurous and warlike spirits, Sikh and Mahommedan,
found a career in the new force of irregulars directed
by the chief commissioner himself, while the Afghan, Dost
Mahommed, kept within his own fastnesses, and the long extent
of frontier at the foot of the passes was patrolled.</p>

<p>Seven years of such work prepared the lately hostile and
always anarchic Punjab under such a pilot as John Lawrence
not only to weather the storm of 1857 but to lead the older
provinces into port. On the 12th of May the news of the
tragedies at Meerut and Delhi reached him at Rawalpindi. The
position was critical in the last degree, for of 50,000 native
soldiers 38,000 were Hindustanis of the very class that had
mutinied elsewhere, and the British troops were few and scattered.
For five days the fate of the Punjab hung upon a thread, for
the question was, &ldquo;Could the 12,000 Punjabis be trusted and
the 38,000 Hindustanis be disarmed?&rdquo; Not an hour was lost
in beginning the disarming at Lahore; and, as one by one the
Hindustani corps succumbed to the epidemic of mutiny, the
sepoys were deported or disappeared, or swelled the military
rabble in and around the city of Delhi. The remembrance of
the ten years&rsquo; war which had closed only in 1849, a bountiful
harvest, the old love of battle, the offer of good pay, but, above
all, the personality of Lawrence and his officers, raised the
Punjabi force into a new army of 59,000 men, and induced the
non-combatant classes to subscribe to a 6% loan. Delhi was
invested, but for three months the rebel city did not fall. Under
John Nicholson, Lawrence sent on still more men to the siege,
till every available European and faithful native soldier was
there, while a movable column swept the country, and the
border was kept by an improvised militia. At length, when
even in the Punjab confidence became doubt, and doubt distrust,
and that was passing into disaffection, John Lawrence was ready
to consider whether we should not give up the Peshawar valley
to the Afghans as a last resource, and send its garrison to recruit
the force around Delhi. Another week and that alternative
must have been faced. But on the 20th of September the city
and palace of Delhi were again in British hands, and the chief
commissioner and his officers united in ascribing &ldquo;to the Lord
our God all the praise due for nerving the hearts of our statesmen
and the arms of our soldiers.&rdquo; As Sir John Lawrence,
Bart., G.C.B., with the thanks of parliament, the gratitude
of his country, and a life pension of ¬£2000 a year in addition
to his ordinary pension of ¬£1000, the &ldquo;saviour of India&rdquo; returned
home in 1859. After guarding the interests of India
and its people as a member of the secretary of state&rsquo;s council,
he was sent out again in 1864 as viceroy and governor-general
on the death of Lord Elgin. If no great crisis enabled Lawrence
to increase his reputation, his five years&rsquo; administration of the
whole Indian empire was worthy of the ruler of the Punjab.
His foreign policy has become a subject of imperial interest,
his name being associated with the &ldquo;close border&rdquo; as opposed
to the &ldquo;forward&rdquo; policy; while his internal administration
was remarkable for financial prudence, a jealous regard for the
good of the masses of the people and of the British soldiers,
and a generous interest in education, especially in its Christian
aspects.</p>

<p>When in 1854 Dost Mahommed, weakened by the antagonism
of his brothers in Kandahar, and by the interference of Persia,
sent his son to Peshawar to make a treaty, Sir John Lawrence
was opposed to any entangling relation with the Afghans after
the experience of 1838-1842, but he obeyed Lord Dalhousie
so far as to sign a treaty of perpetual peace and friendship.
His ruling idea, the fruit of long and sad experience, was that
<i>de facto</i> powers only should be recognized beyond the frontier.
When in 1863 Dost Mahommed&rsquo;s death let loose the factions of
Afghanistan he acted on this policy to such an extent that he
recognized both the sons, Afzul Khan and Shere Ali, at different
times, and the latter fully only when he had made himself master
of all his father&rsquo;s kingdom. The steady advance of Russia from
the north, notwithstanding the Gortchakov circular of 1864, led
to severe criticism of this cautious &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; policy which he
justified under the term of &ldquo;masterly inactivity.&rdquo; But he was
ready to receive Shere Ali in conference, and to aid him in consolidating
his power after it had been established and maintained
for a time, when his term of office came to an end and it fell to
Lord Mayo, his successor, to hold the Umballa conference in
1869. When, nine years after, the second Afghan War was
precipitated, the retired viceroy gave the last days of his life to an
unsparing exposure, in the House of Lords and in the press, of
a policy which he had striven to prevent in its inception, and
which he did not cease to denounce in its course and consequences.</p>

<p>On his final return to England early in 1869, after forty years&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span>
service in and for India, &ldquo;the great proconsul of our English
Christian empire&rdquo; was created Baron Lawrence of the Punjab,
and of Grately, Hants. He assumed the same arms and crest as
those of his brother Henry, with a Pathan and a Sikh trooper as
supporters, and took as his motto &ldquo;Be ready,&rdquo; his brother&rsquo;s
being &ldquo;Never give in.&rdquo; For ten years he gave himself to the
work of the London school board, of which he was the first
chairman, and of the Church missionary society. Towards the
end his eyesight failed, and on the 27th of June 1879 he died at
the age of sixty-eight. He was buried in the nave of Westminster
Abbey, beside Clyde, Outram and Livingstone. He had married
the daughter of the Rev. Richard Hamilton, Harriette-Katherine,
who survived him, and he was succeeded as 2nd baron by his
eldest son, John Hamilton Lawrence (b. 1846).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWRENCE, STRINGER<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> (1697-1775), English soldier, was
born at Hereford on the 6th of March 1697. He seems to have
entered the army in 1727 and served in Gibraltar and Flanders,
subsequently taking part in the battle of Culloden. In 1748,
with the rank of major and the reputation of an experienced
soldier, he went out to India to command the East India Company&rsquo;s
troops. Dupleix&rsquo;s schemes for the French conquest of
southern India were on the point of taking effect, and not long
after his arrival at Fort St David, Stringer Lawrence was actively
engaged. He successfully foiled an attempted French surprise
at Cuddalore, but subsequently was captured by a French cavalry
patrol at Ariancopang near Pondicherry and kept prisoner till
the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1749 he was in command at the
capture of Devicota. On this occasion Clive served under him
and a life-long friendship began. On one occasion, when Clive
had become famous, he honoured the creator of the Indian army
by refusing to accept a sword of honour unless one was voted to
Lawrence also. In 1750 Lawrence returned to England, but
in 1752 he was back in India. Here he found Clive in command
of a force intended for the relief of Trichinopoly. As senior
officer Lawrence took over the command, but was careful to allow
Clive every credit for his share in the subsequent operations,
which included the relief of Trichinopoly and the surrender of
the entire French besieging force. In 1752 with an inferior force
he defeated the French at Bahur (Behoor) and in 1753 again
relieved Trichinopoly. For the next seventeen months he
fought a series of actions in defence of this place, finally arranging
a three months&rsquo; armistice, which was afterwards converted into
a conditional treaty. He had commanded in chief up to the
arrival of the first detachment of regular forces of the crown.
In 1757 he served in the operations against Wandiwash, and in
1758-1759 was in command of Fort St George during the siege
by the French under Lally. In 1759 failing health compelled
him to return to England. He resumed his command in 1761
as major-general and commander-in-chief. Clive supplemented
his old friend&rsquo;s inconsiderable income by settling on him an
annuity of ¬£500 a year. In 1765 he presided over the board
charged with arranging the reorganization of the Madras army,
and he finally retired the following year. He died in London on
the 10th of January 1775. The East India Company erected a
monument to his memory in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWRENCE, SIR THOMAS<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (1769-1830), English painter,
was born at Bristol on the 4th of May 1769. His father was an
innkeeper, first at Bristol and afterwards at Devizes, and at
the age of six Thomas was already shown off to the guests of
the Black Boar as an infant prodigy who could sketch their
likenesses and declaim speeches from Milton. In 1779 the elder
Lawrence had to leave Devizes, having failed in business,
and the precocious talent of the son, who had gained a sort
of reputation along the Bath road, became the support of
the family. His debut as a crayon portrait painter was made
at Oxford, where he was well patronized, and in 1782 the family
settled in Bath, where the young artist soon found himself fully
employed in taking crayon likenesses of the fashionables of the
place at a guinea or a guinea and a half a head. In 1784 he
gained the prize and silver-gilt palette of the Society of Arts for a
crayon drawing after Raphael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Transfiguration,&rdquo; and presently
beginning to paint in oil. Throwing aside the idea of going
on the stage which he had for a short time entertained, he came
to London in 1787, was kindly received by Reynolds, and entered
as a student at the Royal Academy. He began to exhibit almost
immediately, and his reputation increased so rapidly that he
became an associate of the Academy in 1791. The death of Sir
Joshua in 1792 opened the way to further successes. He was
at once appointed painter to the Dilettanti society, and principal
painter to the king in room of Reynolds. In 1794 he was a Royal
Academician, and he became the fashionable portrait painter
of the age, having as his sitters all the rank, fashion and talent
of England, and ultimately most of the crowned heads of Europe.
In 1815 he was knighted; in 1818 he went to Aix-la-Chapelle
to paint the sovereigns and diplomatists gathered there, and
visited Vienna and Rome, everywhere receiving flattering marks
of distinction from princes, due as much to his courtly manners
as to his merits as an artist. After eighteen months he returned
to England, and on the very day of his arrival was chosen president
of the Academy in room of West, who had died a few days
before. This office he held from 1820 to his death on the 7th of
January 1830. He was never married.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Lawrence had all the qualities of personal manner
and artistic style necessary to make a fashionable painter, and
among English portrait painters he takes a high place, though
not as high as that given to him in his lifetime. His more
ambitious works, in the classical style, such as his once celebrated
&ldquo;Satan,&rdquo; are practically forgotten.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The best display of Lawrence&rsquo;s work is in the Waterloo Gallery
of Windsor, a collection of much historical interest. &ldquo;Master
Lambton,&rdquo; painted for Lord Durham at the price of 600 guineas, is
regarded as one of his best portraits, and a fine head in the National
Gallery, London, shows his power to advantage. The <i>Life and
Correspondence of Sir T. Lawrence</i>, by D. E. Williams, appeared in
1831.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWRENCE,<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Douglas county,
Kansas, U.S.A., situated on both banks of the Kansas river,
about 40 m. W. of Kansas City. Pop. (1890) 9997, (1900)
10,862, of whom 2032 were negroes, (1910 census) 12,374.
It is served by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe and the Union
Pacific railways, both having tributary lines extending N. and S.
Lawrence is surrounded by a good farming region, and is itself
a thriving educational and commercial centre. Its site slopes
up from the plateau that borders the river to the heights above,
from which there is a view of rare beauty. Among the city&rsquo;s
principal public buildings are the court house and the Y.M.C.A.
building. The university of Kansas, situated on Mount Oread,
overlooking the city, was first opened in 1866, and in 1907-1908
had a faculty of 105 and 2063 students, including 702 women
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Kansas</a></span>). Just S. of the city of Lawrence is Haskell institute
(1884), one of the largest Indian schools in the country, maintained
for children of the tribal Indians by the national government.
In 1907 the school had 813 students, of whom 313 were
girls; it has an academic department, a business school and
courses in domestic science, in farming, dairying and gardening,
and in masonry, carpentry, painting, blacksmithing, waggon-making,
shoemaking, steam-fitting, printing and other trades.
Among the city&rsquo;s manufactures are flour and grist mill products,
pianos and cement plaster. Lawrence, named in honour of
Amos A. Lawrence, was founded by agents of the Massachusetts
Emigrant Aid Company in July 1854, and during the Territorial
period was the political centre of the free-state cause and the
principal point against which the assaults of the pro-slavery
party were directed. It was first known as Wakarusa, from the
creek by which it lies. A town association was organized in
September 1854 before any Territorial government had been
established. In the next month some pro-slavery men presented
claims to a part of the land, projected a rival town to be called
Excelsior on the same site, and threatened violence; but when
Lawrence had organized its &ldquo;regulators&rdquo; the pro-slavery men
retired and later agreed to a compromise by which the town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>309</span>
site was limited to 640 acres. In December 1855 occurred the
&ldquo;Wakarusa war.&rdquo; A free-state man having been murdered
for his opinions, a friend who threatened retaliation was arrested
by the pro-slavery sheriff, S. J. Jones; he was rescued and taken
to Lawrence; the city disclaimed complicity, but Jones persuaded
Governor Wilson Shannon that there was rebellion, and Shannon
authorized a posse; Missouri responded, and a pro-slavery force
marched on Lawrence. The governor found that Lawrence
had not resisted and would not resist the service of writs; by
a written &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; with the free-state leaders he therefore
withdrew his sanction from the Missourians and averted battle.
The retreating Missourians committed some homicides. It was
during this &ldquo;war&rdquo; that John Brown first took up arms with the
free-state men. Preparations for another attack continued,
particularly after Sheriff Jones, while serving writs in Lawrence,
was wounded. On the 21st of May 1856, at the head of several
hundred Missourians, he occupied the city without resistance,
destroyed its printing offices and the free-state headquarters
and pillaged private houses. In 1855 and again in 1857 the
pro-slavery Territorial legislature passed an Act giving Lawrence
a charter, but the people of Lawrence would not recognize that
&ldquo;bogus&rdquo; government, and on the 13th of July 1857, after an
application to the Topeka free-state legislature for a charter
had been denied, adopted a city charter of their own. Governor
Walker proclaimed this rebellion against the United States,
appeared before the town in command of 400 United States
dragoons and declared it under martial law; as perfect order
prevailed, and there was no overt resistance to Territorial law,
the troops were withdrawn after a few weeks by order of President
Buchanan, and in February 1858 the legislature passed an Act
legalizing the city charter of July 1857. On the 21st of August
1863 William C. Quantrell and some 400 mounted Missouri
bushrangers surprised the sleeping town and murdered 150
citizens. The city&rsquo;s arms were in storage and no resistance was
possible. This was the most distressing episode in all the
turbulence of territorial days and border warfare in Kansas.
A monument erected in 1895 commemorates the dead. After
the free-state men gained control of the Territorial legislature in
1857 the legislature regularly adjourned from Lecompton, the
legal capital, to Lawrence, which was practically the capital
until the choice of Topeka under the Wyandotte constitution.
The first railway to reach Lawrence was the Union Pacific in
1864.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWRENCE,<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> a city, and one of the three county-seats (Salem
and Newburyport are the others) of Essex county, Massachusetts,
U.S.A., on both sides of the Merrimac river, about 30 m. from
its mouth and about 26 m. N.N.W. of Boston. Pop. (1890)
44,654, (1900) 62,559, of whom 28,577 were foreign-born (7058
being Irish, 6999 French Canadians, 5131 English, 2465
German, 1683 English Canadian), and (1910 census) 85,892.
It is served by the Boston &amp; Maine railroad and by
electric railways to Andover, Boston, Lowell, Haverhill and
Salem, Massachusetts, and to Nashua and Salem, New Hampshire.
The city&rsquo;s area of 6.54 sq. m. is about equally divided
by the Merrimac, which is here crossed by a great stone dam
900 ft. long, and, with a fall of 28 ft., supplies about 12,000 horsepower.
Water from the river is carried to factories by a canal
on each side of the river and parallel to it; the first canal was
built on the north side in 1845-1847 and is 1 m. long; the
canal on the south side is about ¬æ m. long, and was built several
years later. There are large and well-kept public parks, a common
(17 acres) with a soldiers&rsquo; monument, a free public library,
with more than 50,000 volumes in 1907, a city hall, county and
municipal court-houses, a county gaol and house of correction,
a county industrial school and a state armoury.</p>

<p>The value of the city&rsquo;s factory product was $48,036,593 in
1905, $41,741,980 in 1900. The manufacture of textiles is
the most important industry; in 1905 the city produced worsteds
valued at $30,926,964 and cotton goods worth $5,745,611,
the worsted product being greater than that of any other American
city. The Wood worsted mill here is said to be the largest single
mill in the world. The history of Lawrence is largely the history
of its textile mills. The town was formed in 1845 from parts of
Andover (S. of the Merrimac) and of Methuen (N. of the river),
and it was incorporated as a town in 1847, being named in honour
of Abbott Lawrence, a director of the Essex company, organized
in 1845 (on the same day as the formation of the town) for the
control of the water power and for the construction of the great
dam across the Merrimac. The Bay State woollen mills,
which in 1858 became the Washington mills, and the Atlantic
cotton mills were both chartered in 1846. The Pacific mills
(1853) introduced from England in 1854 Lister combs for worsted
manufacture; and the Washington mills soon afterward began
to make worsted dress goods. Worsted cloths for men&rsquo;s wear
seem to have been made first about 1870 at nearly the same time
in the Washington mills here, in the Hockanum mills of Rockville,
Connecticut, and in Wanskuck mills, Providence, Rhode
Island. The Pemberton mills, built in 1853, collapsed and afterwards
took fire on the 10th of January 1860; 90 were killed
and hundreds severely injured. Lawrence was chartered as a
city in 1853, and annexed a small part of Methuen in 1854 and
parts of Andover and North Andover in 1879.</p>

of the state, 22 m. (by rail) W. of Cincinnati. Pop. (1890) 4284,
(1900) 4326 (413 foreign-born); (1910) 3930. Lawrenceburg is
served by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio South-Western and the Cleveland,
Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St Louis railways, by the Cincinnati,
Lawrenceburg &amp; Aurora electric street railroad, and by river
packets to Louisville and Cincinnati. The city lies along the river
and on higher land rising 100 ft. above river-level. It formerly
had an important river trade with New Orleans, beginning about
1820 and growing in volume after the city became the terminus
of the Whitewater canal, begun in 1836. The place was laid out
in 1802. In 1846 an &ldquo;old&rdquo; and a &ldquo;new&rdquo; settlement were
united, and Lawrenceburg was chartered as a city. Lawrenceburg
was the birthplace of James B. Eads, the famous engineer,
and of John Coit Spooner (b. 1843), a prominent Republican
member of the United States Senate from Wisconsin in 1885-1891
and in 1897-1907; and the Presbyterian Church of Lawrenceburg
was the first charge (1837-1839) of Henry Ward
Beecher.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWSON, CECIL GORDON<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> (1851-1882), English landscape
painter, was the youngest son of William Lawson of Edinburgh,
esteemed as a portrait painter. His mother also was known
for her flower pieces. He was born near Shrewsbury on the
3rd of December 1851. Two of his brothers (one of them,
Malcolm, a clever musician and song-writer) were trained as
artists, and Cecil was from childhood devoted to art with the
intensity of a serious nature. Soon after his birth the Lawsons
moved to London. Lawson&rsquo;s first works were studies of fruit,
flowers, &amp;c., in the manner of W. Hunt; followed by riverside
Chelsea subjects. His first exhibit at the Royal Academy
(1870) was &ldquo;Cheyne Walk,&rdquo; and in 1871 he sent two other
Chelsea subjects. These gained full recognition from fellow-artists,
if not from the public. Among his friends were now
numbered Fred Walker, G. J. Pinwell and their associates.
Following them, he made a certain number of drawings for
wood-engraving. Lawson&rsquo;s Chelsea pictures had been painted in
somewhat low and sombre tones; in the &ldquo;Hymn to Spring&rdquo;
of 1872 (rejected by the Academy) he turned to a more joyous
play of colour, helped by work in more romantic scenes in North
Wales and Ireland. Early in 1874 he made a short tour in
Holland, Belgium and Paris; and in the summer he painted
his large &ldquo;Hop Gardens of England.&rdquo; This was much praised
at the Academy of 1876. But Lawson&rsquo;s triumph was with the
great luxuriant canvas &ldquo;The Minister&rsquo;s Garden,&rdquo; exhibited
in 1878 at the Grosvenor Gallery, and now in the Manchester
Art Gallery. This was followed by several works conceived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
in a new and tragic mood. His health began to fail, but he
worked on. He married in 1879 the daughter of Birnie Philip,
and settled at Haslemere. His later subjects are from this
neighbourhood (the most famous being &ldquo;The August Moon,&rdquo;
now in the National Gallery of British Art) or from Yorkshire.
Towards the end of 1881 he went to the Riviera, returned in the
spring, and died at Haslemere on the 10th of June 1882. Lawson
may be said to have restored to English landscape the tradition
of Gainsborough, Crome and Constable, infused with an imaginative
intensity of his own. Among English landscape painters
of the latter part of the 19th century his is in many respects
the most interesting name.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWSON, SIR JOHN<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (d. 1665), British sailor, was born at
Scarborough. Joining the parliamentary navy in 1642, he
accompanied Penn to the Mediterranean in 1650, where he
served for some time. In 1652 he served under Blake in the
Dutch War and was present at the first action in the Downs and
the battle of the Kentish Knock. At Portland, early in 1653,
he was vice-admiral of the red, and his ship was severely handled.
Lawson took part in the battles of June and July in the following
summer. In 1654-1655 he commanded in the North Sea and
the Channel. Appointed in January 1655-1656 as Blake&rsquo;s
second-in-command, Lawson was a few weeks later summarily
dismissed from his command, probably for political reasons.
He was a Republican and Anabaptist, and therefore an enemy
to Cromwell. It is not improbable that like Penn and others
he was detected in correspondence with the exiled Charles II.,
who certainly hoped for his support. In 1657, along with
Harrison and others, he was arrested and, for a short time,
imprisoned for conspiring against Cromwell. Afterwards he
lived at Scarborough until the fall of Richard Cromwell&rsquo;s government.
During the troubled months which succeeded that event
Lawson, flying his flag as admiral of the Channel fleet, played a
marked political r√¥le. His ships escorted Charles to England,
and he was soon afterwards knighted. Sent out in 1661 with
Montagu, earl of Sandwich, to the Mediterranean, Lawson
conducted a series of campaigns against the piratical states of
the Algerian coast. Thence summoned to a command in the
Dutch War, he was mortally wounded at Lowestoft. He died
on the 29th of June 1665.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAWSON, SIR WILFRID<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span>, Bart. (1829-1906), English
politician and temperance leader, son of the 1st baronet (d. 1867),
was born on the 4th of September 1829. He was always an
enthusiast in the cause of total abstinence, and in parliament,
to which he was first elected in 1859 for Carlisle, he became
its leading spokesman. In 1864 he first introduced his Permissive
Bill, giving to a two-thirds majority in any district a veto upon
the granting of licences for the sale of intoxicating liquors;
and though this principle failed to be embodied in any act, he
had the satisfaction of seeing a resolution on its lines accepted
by a majority in the House of Commons in 1880, 1881 and 1883.
He lost his seat for Carlisle in 1865, but in 1868 was again returned
as a supporter of Mr Gladstone, and was member till 1885;
though defeated for the new Cockermouth division of Cumberland
in 1885, he won that seat in 1886, and he held it till the election
of 1900, when his violent opposition to the Boer War caused his
defeat, but in 1903 he was returned for the Camborne division
of Cornwall and at the general election of 1906 was once more
elected for his old constituency in Cumberland. During all
these years he was the champion of the United Kingdom Alliance
(founded 1853), of which he became president. An extreme
Radical, he also supported disestablishment, abolition of the
House of Lords, and disarmament. Though violent in the
expression of his opinions, Sir Wilfrid Lawson remained very
popular for his own sake both in and out of the House of
Commons; he became well known for his humorous vein, his
faculty for composing topical doggerel being often exercised on
questions of the day. He died on the 1st of July 1906.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAY,<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> a word of several meanings. Apart from obsolete and
dialectical usages, such as the East Anglian word meaning
&ldquo;pond,&rdquo; possibly cognate with Lat. <i>lacus</i>, pool or lake, or its
use in weaving for the batten of a loom, where it is a variant form
of &ldquo;lath,&rdquo; the chief uses are as follows: (1) A song or, more
accurately, a short poem, lyrical or narrative, which could be
sung or accompanied by music; such were the romances sung
by minstrels. Such an expression as the &ldquo;Lay of the Nibelungen&rdquo;
is due to mistaken association of the word with Ger. <i>Lied</i>, song,
which appears in Anglo-Saxon as <i>l√©o√∞</i>. &ldquo;Lay&rdquo; comes from
O. Fr. <i>lai</i>, of which the derivation is doubtful. The <i>New English
Dictionary</i> rejects Celtic origins sometimes put forward, such as
Ir. <i>laoidh</i>, Welsh <i>llais</i>, and takes O. Mid. and High Ger. <i>leich</i>
as the probable source. (2) &ldquo;Non-clerical&rdquo; or &ldquo;unlearned.&rdquo;
In this sense &ldquo;lay&rdquo; comes directly from Fr. <i>lai</i> (<i>la√Øque</i>, the
learned form nearer to the Latin, is now used) from Lat. <i>laicus</i>,
Gr. <span class="grk" title="laikos">&#955;&#945;&#970;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>, of or belonging to the people (<span class="grk" title="laos">&#955;&#945;&#972;&#962;</span>, Attic <span class="grk" title="le√¥s">&#955;&#949;&#974;&#962;</span>).
The word is now specially applied to persons who are not in
orders, and more widely to those who do not belong to other
learned professions, particularly the law and medicine. The
<i>New English Dictionary</i> quotes two examples from versions of
the Bible. In the Douai version of 1 Sam. xxi. 4, Ahimelech
tells David that he has &ldquo;no lay bread at hand but only holy
bread&rdquo;; here the Authorized Version has &ldquo;common bread,&rdquo;
the Vulgate <i>laicos panes</i>. In Coverdale&rsquo;s version of Acts iv. 13,
the high priest and his kindred marvel at Peter and John as
being &ldquo;unlearned and lay people&rdquo;; the Authorized Version
has &ldquo;unlearned and ignorant men.&rdquo; In a cathedral of the
Church of England &ldquo;lay clerks&rdquo; and &ldquo;lay vicars&rdquo; sing such
portions of the service as may be performed by laymen and
clergy in minor orders. &ldquo;Lay readers&rdquo; are persons who are
granted a commission by the bishop to perform certain religious
duties in a particular parish. The commission remains in force
until it is revoked by the bishop or his successors, or till there
is a new incumbent in the parish, when it has to be renewed.
In a religious order a &ldquo;lay brother&rdquo; is freed from duties at
religious services performed by the other members, and from
their studies, but is bound by vows of obedience and chastity
and serves the order by manual labour. For &ldquo;lay impropriator&rdquo;

<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tithes</a></span>; see further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Laymen, House of</a></span>. (3) &ldquo;Lay&rdquo; as a
verb means &ldquo;to make to lie down,&rdquo; &ldquo;to place upon the ground,&rdquo;
&amp;c. The past tense is &ldquo;laid&rdquo;; it is vulgarly confused with the
verb &ldquo;to lie,&rdquo; of which the past is &ldquo;lay.&rdquo; The common root
of both &ldquo;lie&rdquo; and &ldquo;lay&rdquo; is represented by O. Teut. <i>leg</i>;
cf. Dutch <i>leggen</i>, Ger. <i>legen</i>, and Eng. &ldquo;ledge.&rdquo;<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (4) &ldquo;Lay-figure&rdquo;
is the name commonly given to articulated figures of
human beings or animals, made of wood, papier-mach√© or other
materials; draped and posed, such figures serve as models for
artists (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Models</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Artists</a></span>). The word has no connexion with
&ldquo;to lay,&rdquo; to place in position, but is an adaptation of the word
&ldquo;layman,&rdquo; commonly used with this meaning in the 18th
century. This was adapted from Dutch <i>leeman</i> (the older form
is <i>ledenman</i>) and meant an &ldquo;articulated or jointed man&rdquo; from
<i>led</i>, now <i>lid</i>, a joint; cf. Ger. <i>Gliedermann</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAYA, JEAN LOUIS<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> (1761-1833), French dramatist, was
born in Paris on the 4th of December 1761 and died in August
1833. He wrote his first comedy in collaboration with Gabriel
M. J. B. Legouv√© in 1785, but the piece, though accepted by
the Com√©die Fran√ßaise, was never represented. In 1789 he
produced a plea for religious toleration in the form of a five-act
tragedy in verse, <i>Jean Calas</i>; the injustice of the disgrace cast
on a family by the crime of one of its members formed the theme
of <i>Les Dangers de l&rsquo;opinion</i> (1790); but it is by his <i>Ami des
lois</i> (1793) that Laya is remembered. This energetic protest
against mob-rule, with its scarcely veiled characterizations of
Robespierre as Nomophage and of Marat as Duricr√¢ne, was
an act of the highest courage, for the play was produced at
the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais (temporarily Th√©√¢tre de la Nation) only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>
nineteen days before the execution of Louis XVI. Ten days after
its first production the piece was prohibited by the commune,
but the public demanded its representation; the mayor of
Paris was compelled to appeal to the convention, and the piece
was played while some 30,000 Parisians guarded the hall. Laya
went into hiding, and several persons convicted of having a copy
of the obnoxious play in their possession were guillotined. At
the end of the Terror Laya returned to Paris. In 1813 he replaced
Delille in the Paris chair of literary history and French
poetry; he was admitted to the Academy in 1817. Laya produced
in 1797 <i>Les Deux Stuarts</i>, and in 1799 <i>Falkland</i>, the title-r√¥le
of which provided Talma with one of his finest opportunities.
Laya&rsquo;s works, which chiefly owe their interest to the
circumstances attending their production, were collected in
1836-1837.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAYAMON,<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> early English poet, was the author of a chronicle
of Britain entitled <i>Brut</i>, a paraphrase of the <i>Brut d&rsquo;Angleterre</i>
by Wace, a native of Jersey, who is also known as the author
of the <i>Roman de Rou</i>. The excellent edition of Layamon by Sir
F. Madden (Society of Antiquaries, London, 1847) should be
consulted. All that is known concerning Layamon is derived
from two extant MSS., which present texts that often vary
considerably, and it is necessary to understand their comparative
value before any conclusions can be drawn. The older text
(here called the A-text) lies very near the original text, which
is unfortunately lost, though it now and then omits lines which
are absolutely necessary to the sense. The later text (here called
the B-text) represents a later recension of the original version
by another writer who frequently omits couplets, and alters
the language by the substitution of better-known words for
such as seemed to be obsolescent; <i>e.g.</i> <i>harme</i> (harm) in place
of <i>balewe</i> (bale), and <i>dead</i> in place of <i>feie</i> (fated to die, or dead).
Hence little reliance can be placed on the B-text, its chief merit
being that it sometimes preserves couplets which seem to have
been accidentally omitted in A; besides which, it affords a
valuable commentary on the original version.</p>

<p>We learn from the brief prologue that Layamon was a priest
among the people, and was the son of Leovenath (a late spelling
of A.-S. Leofnoth); also, that he lived at Ernley, at a noble
church on Severn bank, close by Radstone. This is certainly
Areley Regis, or Areley Kings, close by Redstone rock and
ferry, 1 m. to the S. of Stourport in Worcestershire. The B-text
turns Layamon into the later form Laweman, <i>i.e.</i> Law-man,
correctly answering to Chaucer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Man of Lawe,&rdquo; though here
apparently used as a mere name. It also turns Leovenath into
Leuca, <i>i.e.</i> Leofeca, a diminutive of Leofa, which is itself a pet-name
for Leofnoth; so that there is no real contradiction. But
it absurdly substitutes &ldquo;with the good knight,&rdquo; which is practically
meaningless, for &ldquo;at a noble church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We know no more about Layamon except that he was a
great lover of books; and that he procured three books in
particular which he prized above others, &ldquo;turning over the
leaves, and beholding them lovingly.&rdquo; These were: the
English book that St Beda made; another in Latin that
St Albin and St Austin made; whilst the third was made
by a French clerk named Wace, who (in 1155) gave a copy to
the noble Eleanor, who was queen of the high king Henry (<i>i.e.</i>
Henry II.).</p>

<p>The first of these really means the Anglo-Saxon translation
of Beda&rsquo;s <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, which begins with the words:
&ldquo;Ic Beda, Cristes theow,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;I, Beda, Christ&rsquo;s servant.&rdquo;
The second is a strange description of the original of the translation,
<i>i.e.</i> Albinus Beda&rsquo;s own Latin book, the second paragraph
of which begins with the words: &ldquo;Auctor ante omnes atque
adiutor opusculi huius Albinus Abba reverentissimus vir per
omnia doctissimus extitit&rdquo;; which Layamon evidently misunderstood.
As to the share of St Augustine in this work,
see Book I., chapters 23-34, and Book II., chapters 1 and 2,
which are practically all concerned with him and occupy more
than a tenth of the whole work. The third book was Wace&rsquo;s
poem, <i>Brut d&rsquo;Angleterre</i>. But we find that although Layamon
had ready access to all three of these works, he soon settled
down to the translation of the third, without troubling much
about the others. His chief obligation to Beda is for the well-known
story about Pope Gregory and the English captives at
Rome; see Layamon, vol. iii. 180.</p>

<p>It is impossible to enter here upon a discussion of the numerous
points of interest which a proper examination of this vast and
important work would present to any careful inquirer. Only
a few bare results can be here enumerated. The A-text may
be dated about 1205, and the B-text (practically by another
writer) about 1275. Both texts, the former especially, are
remarkably free from admixture with words of French origin;
the lists that have been given hitherto are inexact, but it may
be said that the number of French words in the A-text can hardly
exceed 100, or in the B-text 160. Layamon&rsquo;s work is largely
original; Wace&rsquo;s <i>Brut</i> contains 15,300 lines, and Layamon&rsquo;s
32,240 lines of a similar length; and many of Layamon&rsquo;s
additions to Wace are notable, such as his story &ldquo;regarding the
fairy elves at Arthur&rsquo;s birth, and his transportation by them after
death in a boat to Avalon, the abode of Argante, their queen&rdquo;;
see Sir F. Madden&rsquo;s pref. p. xv. Wace&rsquo;s <i>Brut</i> is almost wholly
a translation of the Latin chronicle concerning the early history
of Britain by Geoffrey of Monmouth, who said that he obtained
his materials from a manuscript written in Welsh. The name
Brut is the French form of Brutus, who was the fabulous grandson
of Ascanius, and great-grandson of Aeneas of Troy, the hero
of Virgil&rsquo;s <i>Aeneid</i>. After many adventures, this Brutus arrived
in England, founded Troynovant or New Troy (better known
as London), and was the progenitor of a long line of British
kings, among whom were Locrine, Bladud, Leir, Gorboduc,
Ferrex and Porrex, Lud, Cymbeline, Constantine, Vortigern,
Uther and Arthur; and from this mythical Brutus the name
Brut was transferred so as to denote the entire chronicle of this
British history. Layamon gives the whole story, from the time
of Brutus to that of Cadwalader, who may be identified with the
Caedwalla of the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, baptized by Pope
Sergius in the year 688. Both texts of Layamon are in a south-western
dialect; the A-text in particular shows the Wessex
dialect of earlier times (commonly called Anglo-Saxon) in a
much later form, and we can hardly doubt that the author,
as he intimates, could read the old version of Beda intelligently.
The remarks upon the B-text in Sir F. Madden&rsquo;s preface are not
to the point; the peculiar spellings to which he refers (such as
<i>same</i> for <i>shame</i>) are by no means due to any confusion with the
Northumbrian dialect, but rather to the usual vagaries of a scribe
who knew French better than English, and had some difficulty
in acquiring the English pronunciation and in representing
it accurately. At the same time, he was not strong in English
grammar, and was apt to confuse the plural form with the
singular in the tenses of verbs; and this is the simple explanation
of most of the examples of so-called &ldquo;nunnation&rdquo; in this poem
(such as the use of <i>wolden</i> for <i>wolde</i>), which only existed in
writing and must not be seriously considered as representing real
spoken sounds. The full proof of this would occupy too much
space; but it should be noticed that, in many instances, &ldquo;this
pleonastic <i>n</i> has been struck out or erased by a second hand.&rdquo;
In other instances it has escaped notice, and that is all that need
be said. The peculiar metre of the poem has been sufficiently
treated by J. Schipper. An abstract of the poem has been
given by Henry Morley; and good general criticisms of it by
B. ten Brink and others.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAYARD, SIR AUSTEN HENRY<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span> (1817-1894), British author
and diplomatist, the excavator of Nineveh, was born in Paris
on the 5th of March 1817. The Layards were of Huguenot
descent. His father, Henry P. J. Layard, of the Ceylon Civil
Service, was the son of Charles Peter Layard, dean of Bristol,
and grandson of Daniel Peter Layard, the physician. Through
his mother, a daughter of Nathaniel Austen, banker, of Ramsgate,
he inherited Spanish blood. This strain of cosmopolitanism
must have been greatly strengthened by the circumstances of his
education. Much of his boyhood was spent in Italy, where he
received part of his schooling, and acquired a taste for the fine
arts and a love of travel; but he was at school also in England,
France and Switzerland. After spending nearly six years in
the office of his uncle, Benjamin Austen, a solicitor, he was
tempted to leave England for Ceylon by the prospect of obtaining
an appointment in the civil service, and he started in 1839 with
the intention of making an overland journey across Asia. After
wandering for many months, chiefly in Persia, and having
abandoned his intention of proceeding to Ceylon, he returned
in 1842 to Constantinople, where he made the acquaintance of
Sir Stratford Canning, the British ambassador, who employed
him in various unofficial diplomatic missions in European Turkey.
In 1845, encouraged and assisted by Canning, Layard left Constantinople
to make those explorations among the ruins of
Assyria with which his name is chiefly associated. This expedition
was in fulfilment of a design which he had formed, when,
during his former travels in the East, his curiosity had been
greatly excited by the ruins of Nimrud on the Tigris, and by the
great mound of Kuyunjik, near Mosul, already partly excavated
by Botta. Layard remained in the neighbourhood of Mosul,
carrying on excavations at Kuyunjik and Nimrud, and investigating
the condition of various tribes, until 1847; and,
returning to England in 1848, published <i>Nineveh and its Remains:
with an Account of a Visit to the Chaldaean Christians of Kurdistan,
and the Yezidis, or Devil-worshippers; and an Inquiry into the
Manners and Arts of the Ancient Assyrians</i> (2 vols., 1848-1849). To
illustrate the antiquities described in this work he published a
large folio volume of <i>Illustrations of the Monuments of Nineveh</i>
(1849). After spending a few months in England, and receiving
the degree of D.C.L. from the university of Oxford, Layard
returned to Constantinople as attach√© to the British embassy,
and, in August 1849, started on a second expedition, in the course
of which he extended his investigations to the ruins of Babylon
and the mounds of southern Mesopotamia. His record of this
expedition, <i>Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon</i>,
which was illustrated by another folio volume, called <i>A Second
Series of the Monuments of Nineveh</i>, was published in 1853.
During these expeditions, often in circumstances of great
difficulty, Layard despatched to England the splendid specimens
which now form the greater part of the collection of Assyrian
antiquities in the British Museum. Apart from the archaeological
value of his work in identifying Kuyunjik as the site of
Nineveh, and in providing a great mass of materials for scholars
to work upon, these two books of Layard&rsquo;s are among the best-written
books of travel in the language.</p>

<p>Layard now turned to politics. Elected as a Liberal member
for Aylesbury in 1852, he was for a few weeks under-secretary
for foreign affairs, but afterwards freely criticized the government,
especially in connexion with army administration. He
was present in the Crimea during the war, and was a member of
the committee appointed to inquire into the conduct of the
expedition. In 1855 he refused from Lord Palmerston an office
not connected with foreign affairs, was elected lord rector of
Aberdeen university, and on 15th June moved a resolution in the
House of Commons (defeated by a large majority) declaring that
in public appointments merit had been sacrificed to private
influence and an adherence to routine. After being defeated
at Aylesbury in 1857, he visited India to investigate the causes
of the Mutiny. He unsuccessfully contested York in 1859, but
was elected for Southwark in 1860, and from 1861 to 1866 was
under-secretary for foreign affairs in the successive administrations
of Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell. In 1866 he
was appointed a trustee of the British Museum, and in 1868
chief commissioner of works in W. E. Gladstone&rsquo;s government
and a member of the Privy Council. He retired from parliament
in 1869, on being sent as envoy extraordinary to Madrid. In
1877 he was appointed by Lord Beaconsfield ambassador at
Constantinople, where he remained until Gladstone&rsquo;s return to
power in 1880, when he finally retired from public life. In 1878,
on the occasion of the Berlin conference, he received the grand
cross of the Bath. Layard&rsquo;s political life was somewhat stormy.
His manner was brusque, and his advocacy of the causes which
he had at heart, though always perfectly sincere, was vehement
to the point sometimes of recklessness. Layard retired to
Venice, where he devoted much of his time to collecting pictures
of the Venetian school, and to writing on Italian art. On this
subject he was a disciple of his friend G. Morelli, whose views
he embodied in his revision of F. Kugler&rsquo;s <i>Handbook of Painting,
Italian Schools</i> (1887). He wrote also an introduction to Miss
Ffoulkes&rsquo;s translation of Morelli&rsquo;s <i>Italian Painters</i> (1892-1893),
and edited that part of Murray&rsquo;s <i>Handbook of Rome</i> (1894)
which deals with pictures. In 1887 he published, from notes
taken at the time, a record of his first journey to the East,
entitled <i>Early Adventures in Persia, Susiana and Babylonia</i>.
An abbreviation of this work, which as a book of travel is even
more delightful than its predecessors, was published in 1894,
shortly after the author&rsquo;s death, with a brief introductory notice
by Lord Aberdare. Layard also from time to time contributed
papers to various learned societies, including the Huguenot
Society, of which he was first president. He died in London on
the 5th of July 1894.</p>

their foundation was to associate the laity in the deliberations
of convocation. They have no legal status. The members

of the Society of Jesus, was born in Castile, and after studying
at Alcala joined Ignatius of Loyola in Paris, being one of the
six who with Loyola in August 1534 took the vow of missionary
work in Palestine in the Montmartre church. This plan fell
through, and Laynez became professor of scholastic theology at
Sapienza. After the order had been definitely established (1540)
Laynez was sent to Germany. He was one of the pope&rsquo;s theologians
at the council of Trent (<i>q.v.</i>), where he played a weighty
and decisive part. When Loyola died in 1556 Laynez acted as
vicar of the society, and two years later became general. Before
his death at Rome, on the 19th of January 1565, he had immensely
strengthened the despotic constitution of the order and developed
its educational activities (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jesuits</a></span>).</p>

term is an adaptation in medieval Latin of the name of Lazarus
(<i>q.v.</i>), in Luke xvi. 20, who was supposed to be a leper. The
word was not confined to persons suffering from leprosy; thus

guarysshed and heled viij lazars of the palesey.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lazaretto</span> or <span class="sc">Lazar-House</span> is a hospital for the reception of
poor persons suffering from the plague, leprosy or other infectious
or contagious diseases. A peculiar use of &ldquo;lazaretto&rdquo; is found
in the application of the term, now obsolete, to a place in the
after-part of a merchant vessel for the storage of provisions, &amp;c.

<p><span class="bold">LAZARITES<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Lazarists</span> or <span class="sc">Lazarians</span>), the popular names of
the &ldquo;Congregation of Priests of the Mission&rdquo; in the Roman
Catholic Church. It had its origin in the successful mission to
the common people conducted by St Vincent de Paul (<i>q.v.</i>) and
five other priests on the estates of the Gondi family. More
immediately it dates from 1624, when the little community
acquired a permanent settlement in the coll√®ge des Bons Enfans
in Paris. Archiepiscopal recognition was obtained in 1626;
by a papal bull of the 12th of January 1632, the society was
constituted a congregation, with St Vincent de Paul at its head.
About the same time the canons regular of St Victor handed over
to the congregation the priory of St Lazarus (formerly a lazar-house)
in Paris, whence the name of Lazarites or Lazarists.
Within a few years they had acquired another house in Paris and
set up other establishments throughout France; missions
were also sent to Italy (1638), Tunis (1643), Algiers and Ireland
(1646), Madagascar (1648) and Poland (1651). A fresh bull of
Alexander VII. in April 1655 further confirmed the society;
this was followed by a brief in September of the same year,
regulating its constitution. The rules then adopted, which were
framed on the model of those of the Jesuits, were published
at Paris in 1668 under the title <i>Regulae seu constitutiones communes
congregationis missionis</i>. The special objects contemplated
were the religious instruction of the lower classes, the training of
the clergy and foreign missions. During the French Revolution
the congregation was suppressed and St Lazare plundered by
the mob; it was restored by Napoleon in 1804 at the desire of
Pius VII., abolished by him in 1809 in consequence of a quarrel
with the pope, and again restored in 1816. The Lazarites were
expelled from Italy in 1871 and from Germany in 1873. The
Lazarite province of Poland was singularly prosperous; at the
date of its suppression in 1796 it possessed thirty-five establishments.
The order was permitted to return in 1816, but is now
extinct there. In Madagascar it had a mission from 1648 till
1674. In 1783 Lazarites were appointed to take the place of the
Jesuits in the Levantine and Chinese missions; they still have
some footing in China, and in 1874 their establishments throughout
the Turkish empire numbered sixteen. In addition, they
established branches in Persia, Abyssinia, Mexico, the South
American republics, Portugal, Spain and Russia, some of which
have been suppressed. In the same year they had fourteen
establishments in the United States of America. The total
number of Lazarites throughout the world is computed at about
3000. Amongst distinguished members of the congregation
may be mentioned: P. Collet (1693-1770), writer on theology
and ethics; J. de la Grive (1689-1757), geographer; E. Bor√©
(d. 1878), orientalist; P. Bertholon (1689-1757), physician;
and Armand David, Chinese missionary and traveller.</p>

New Testament in two connexions.</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Lazarus of Bethany</span>, brother of Martha and Mary. The
story that he died and after four days was raised from the
dead is told by John (xi., xii.) only, and is not mentioned by the
Synoptists. By many this is regarded as the greatest of Christ&rsquo;s
miracles. It produced a great effect upon many Jews; the
<i>Acta Pilati</i> says that Pilate trembled when he heard of it, and,
according to Bayle&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>, Spinoza declared that if he
were persuaded of its truth he would become a Christian. The
story has been attacked more vigorously than any other portion
of the Fourth Gospel, mainly on two grounds, (i.) the fact that,
in spite of its striking character, it is omitted by the Synoptists,
and (ii.) its unique significance. The personality of Lazarus in
John&rsquo;s account, his relation to Martha and Mary, and the
possibility that John reconstructed the story by the aid of
inferences from the story of the supper in Luke x. 40, and
that of the anointing of Christ in Bethany given by Mark and
Matthew, are among the chief problems. The controversy has
given rise to a great mass of literature, discussions of which will
be found in the lives of Christ, the biblical encyclopaedias and
the commentaries on St John.</p>

<p>2. <span class="sc">Lazarus</span> is also the name given by Luke (xvi. 20) to the
beggar in the parable known as that of &ldquo;Lazarus and Dives,&rdquo;<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
illustrating the misuse of wealth. There is little doubt that the
name is introduced simply as part of the parable, and not with
any idea of identifying the beggar with Lazarus of Bethany. It
is curious, not only that Luke&rsquo;s story does not appear in the other
gospels, but also that in no other of Christ&rsquo;s parables is a name
given to the central character. Hence it was in early times
thought that the story was historical, not allegorical (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lazar</a></span>).</p>

a conventional name for a rich man.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAZARUS, EMMA<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> (1849-1887), American Jewish poetess,
was born in New York. When the Civil War broke out she was
soon inspired to lyric expression. Her first book (1867) included
poems and translations which she wrote between the ages of
fourteen and seventeen. As yet her models were classic and
romantic. At the age of twenty-one she published <i>Admetus and
other Poems</i> (1871). <i>Admetus</i> is inscribed to Emerson, who
greatly influenced her, and with whom she maintained a regular
correspondence for several years. She led a retired life, and had
a modest conception of her own powers. Much of her next work
appeared in <i>Lippincott&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, but in 1874 she published a
prose romance (<i>Alide</i>) based on Goethe&rsquo;s autobiography, and
received a generous letter of admiration from Turgeniev. Two
years later she visited Concord and made the acquaintance of the
Emerson circle, and while there read the proof-sheets of her
tragedy <i>The Spagnoletto</i>. In 1881 she published her excellent
translations of Heine&rsquo;s poems. Meanwhile events were occurring
which appealed to her Jewish sympathies and gave a new turn
to her feeling. The Russian massacres of 1880-1881 were a
trumpet-call to her. So far her Judaism had been latent. She
belonged to the oldest Jewish congregation of New York, but she
had not for some years taken a personal part in the observances
of the synagogue. But from this time she took up the cause of
her race, and &ldquo;her verse rang out as it had never rung before, a
clarion note, calling a people to heroic action and unity; to the
consciousness and fulfilment of a grand destiny.&rdquo; Her poems,
&ldquo;The Crowing of the Red Cock&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Banner of the Jew&rdquo;
(1882) stirred the Jewish consciousness and helped to produce
the new Zionism (<i>q.v.</i>). She now wrote another drama, the <i>Dance
to Death</i>, the scene of which is laid in Nordhausen in the 14th
century; it is based on the accusation brought against the Jews
of poisoning the wells and thus causing the Black Death. The
<i>Dance to Death</i> was included (with some translations of medieval
Hebrew poems) in <i>Songs of a Semite</i> (1882), which she dedicated
to George Eliot. In 1885 she visited Europe. She devoted
much of the short remainder of her life to the cause of Jewish
nationalism. In 1887 appeared <i>By the waters of Babylon</i>,
which consists of a series of &ldquo;prose poems,&rdquo; full of prophetic
fire. She died in New York on the 19th of November 1887. A
sonnet by Emma Lazarus is engraved on a memorial tablet
on the colossal Bartholdi statue of Liberty, New York.</p>

of Blizard, bandmaster of the Royal Military Asylum, Chelsea,
and subsequently of Charles Godfrey, senior, bandmaster of the

execution were greatly admired. He was professor of the clarinet
at the Royal Academy of Music from 1854 until within a short

at the Military School of Music, Kneller Hall, in 1858. His

<p><span class="bold">LAZARUS, MORITZ<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> (1824-1903), German philosopher, was
born on the 15th of September 1824 at Filehne, Posen. The
son of a rabbinical scholar, he was educated in Hebrew literature
and history, and subsequently in law and philosophy at the
university of Berlin. From 1860 to 1866 he was professor in
the university of Berne, and subsequently returned to Berlin
as professor of philosophy in the kriegsakademie (1868) and
later in the university of Berlin (1873). On the occasion of his
seventieth birthday he was honoured with the title of <i>Geheimrath</i>.
The fundamental principle of his philosophy was that truth
must be sought not in metaphysical or a priori abstractions but
in psychological investigation, and further that this investigation
cannot confine itself successfully to the individual consciousness,
but must be devoted primarily to society as a whole. The
psychologist must study mankind from the historical or comparative
standpoint, analysing the elements which constitute the
fabric of society, with its customs, its conventions and the
main tendencies of its evolution. This <i>V√∂lkerpsychologie</i> (folk- or
comparative psychology) is one of the chief developments of
the Herbartian theory of philosophy; it is a protest not only
against the so-called scientific standpoint of natural philosophers,
but also against the individualism of the positivists. In support
of his theory he founded, in combination with H. Steinthal,
the <i>Zeitschrift f√ºr V√∂lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft</i>
(1859). His own contributions to this periodical were numerous
and important. His chief work was <i>Das Leben der Seele</i> (Berlin,
1855-1857; 3rd edition, 1883). Other philosophical works
were:&mdash;<i>Ueber den Ursprung der Sitten</i> (1860 and 1867), <i>Ueber
die Ideen in der Geschichte</i> (1865 and 1872); <i>Zur Lehre von den
Sinnest√§uschungen</i> (1867); <i>Ideale Fragen</i> (1875 and 1885),
<i>Erziehung und Geschichte</i> (1881); <i>Unser Standpunkt</i> (1881);
<i>Ueber die Reize des Spiels</i> (1883). Apart from the great interest
of his philosophical work, Lazarus was pre-eminent among the
Jews of the so-called Semitic domination in Germany. Like
Heine, Auerbach and Steinthal, he rose superior to the narrower
ideals of the German Jews, and took a leading place in German
literature and thought. He protested against the violent
anti-Semitism of the time, and, in spite of the moderate tone
of his publications, drew upon himself unqualified censure. He
wrote in this connexion a number of articles collected in 1887
under the title <i>Treu und Frei. Reden und Vortr√§ge √ºber Juden
und Judenthum</i>. In 1869 and 1871 he was president of the
first and second Jewish Synods at Leipzig and Augsburg.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAZARUS, ST, ORDER OF,<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> a religious and military order
founded in Jerusalem about the middle of the 12th century.
Its primary object was the tending of the sick, especially lepers,
of whom Lazarus (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lazar</a></span>) was regarded as the patron.
From the 13th century, the order made its way into various
countries of Europe&mdash;Sicily, Lower Italy and Germany
(Thuringia); but its chief centre of activity was France, where
Louis IX. (1253) gave the members the lands of Boigny near
Orleans and a building at the gates of Paris, which they turned
into a lazar-house for the use of the lepers of the city. A papal
confirmation was obtained from Alexander IV. in 1255. The
knights were one hundred in number, and possessed the right
of marrying and receiving pensions charged on ecclesiastical
benefices. An eight-pointed cross was the insignia of both the
French and Italian orders. The gradual disappearance of
leprosy combined with other causes to secularize the order more
and more. In Savoy in 1572 it was merged by Gregory XIII.
(at the instance of Emanuel Philibert, duke of Savoy) in the
order of St Maurice (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Knighthood and Chivalry</a></span>: <i>Orders
of Knighthood, Italy</i>). The chief task of this branch was the
defence of the Catholic faith, especially against the Protestantism
of Geneva. It continued to exist till the second half of the 19th
century. In 1608 it was in France united by Henry IV. with
the order of Notre-Dame du Mont-Carmel. It was treated with
especial favour by Louis XIV., and the most brilliant period
of its existence was from 1673 to 1691, under the marquis de
Louvois. From that time it began to decay. It was abolished
at the Revolution, reintroduced during the Restoration, and
formally abolished by a state decree of 1830.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEA, HENRY CHARLES<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (1825-1909), American historian,
was born at Philadelphia on the 19th of September 1825.
His father was a publisher, whom in 1843 he joined in business,
and he retained his connexion with the firm till 1880. Weak
health, however, caused him from early days to devote himself
to research, mainly on church history in the later middle ages,
and his literary reputation rests on the important books he
produced on this subject. These are: <i>Superstition and Force</i>
(Philadelphia, 1866, new ed. 1892); <i>Historical Sketch of Sacerdotal
Celibacy</i> (Philadelphia, 1867); <i>History of the Inquisition of the
Middle Ages</i> (New York, 1888); <i>Chapters from the religious
history of Spain connected with the Inquisition</i> (Philadelphia,
1890); <i>History of auricular Confession and Indulgences in the

(Philadelphia, 1901), and <i>History of the Inquisition of Spain</i>
(4 vols., New York and London, 1906-1907). He also edited
a <i>Formulary of the Papal Penitentiary in the 13th century</i> (Philadelphia,

Spanish Dependencies</i>. As an authority on the Inquisition he
stood in the highest rank of modern historians, and distinctions
were conferred on him by the universities of Harvard, Princeton,
Pennsylvania, Giessen and Moscow. He died at Philadelphia

<p><span class="bold">LEAD<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> (pronounced <i>leed</i>), a city of Lawrence county, South
Dakota, U.S.A., situated in the Black Hills, at an altitude of
about 5300 ft., 3 m. S.W. of Deadwood. Pop. (1890) 2581, (1900)
6210, of whom 2145 were foreign-born, (1905) 8217, (1910) 8392.
In 1905 it was second in population among the cities of the
state. It is served by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy, the
Chicago &amp; North-Western, and the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp;
St Paul railways. Lead has a hospital, the Hearst Free Library
and the Hearst Free Kindergarten, and is the see of a Roman
Catholic bishopric. It is the centre of the mining interests of the
Black Hills, and the Homestake Gold Mine here contains perhaps
the largest and most easily worked mass of low-grade ore and
one of the largest mining plants (1000 stamps) in the world; it
has also three cyanide mills. From 1878 to 1906 the value of the
gold taken from this mine amounted to about $58,000,000, and
the net value of the product of 1906 alone was approximately
$5,313,516. For two months in the spring of 1907 the mine
was rendered idle by a fire (March 25), which was so severe that
it was necessary to flood the entire mine. Mining tools and gold
jewelry are manufactured. The first settlement was made here
by mining prospectors in July 1876. Lead was chartered as a
city in 1890 and became a city of the first class in 1904.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEAD,<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> a metallic chemical element; its symbol is Pb (from
the Lat. <i>plumbum</i>), and atomic weight 207.10 (O = 16). This
metal was known to the ancients, and is mentioned in the Old
Testament. The Romans used it largely, as it is still used, for
the making of water pipes, and soldered these with an alloy of
lead and tin. Pliny treats of these two metals as <i>plumbum
nigrum</i> and <i>plumbum album</i> respectively, which seems to show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>315</span>
that at his time they were looked upon as being only two varieties
of the same species. In regard to the ancients&rsquo; knowledge of
lead compounds, we may state that the substance described
by Dioscorides as <span class="grk" title="molybdaina">&#956;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#946;&#948;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#945;</span> was undoubtedly litharge, that
Pliny uses the word minium in its present sense of red lead, and
that white lead was well known to Geber in the 8th century.
The alchemists designated it by the sign of Saturn <img style="width:17px; height:22px" src="images/img315.jpg" alt="" />.</p>

<p><i>Occurrence.</i>&mdash;Metallic lead occurs in nature but very rarely
and then only in minute amount. The chief lead ores are galena
and cerussite; of minor importance are anglesite, pyromorphite
and mimetesite (<i>qq.v.</i>). Galena (<i>q.v.</i>), the principal lead ore,
has a world-wide distribution, and is always contaminated with
silver sulphide, the proportion of noble metal varying from about
0.01 or less to 0.3%, and in rare cases coming up to ¬Ω or 1%.
Fine-grained galena is usually richer in silver than the coarse-grained.
Galena occurs in veins in the Cambrian clay-slate,
accompanied by copper and iron pyrites, zinc-blende, quartz, calc-spar,
iron-spar, &amp;c.; also in beds or nests within sandstones and
rudimentary limestones, and in a great many other geological
formations. It is pretty widely diffused throughout the earth&rsquo;s
crust. The principal English lead mines are in Derbyshire; but
there are also mines at Allandale and other parts of western
Northumberland, at Alston Moor and other parts of Cumberland,
in the western parts of Durham, in Swaledale and Arkendale
and other parts of Yorkshire, in Salop, in Cornwall, in the
Mendip Hills in Somersetshire, and in the Isle of Man. The
Welsh mines are chiefly in Flint, Cardigan and Montgomery
shires; the Scottish in Dumfries, Lanark and Argyll; and the
Irish in Wicklow, Waterford and Down. Of continental mines
we may mention those in Saxony and in the Harz, Germany;
those of Carinthia, Austria; and especially those of the southern
provinces of Spain. It is widely distributed in the United States,
and occurs in Mexico and Brazil; it is found in Tunisia and
Algeria, in the Altai Mountains and India, and in New South
Wales, Queensland, and in Tasmania.</p>

<p>The native carbonate or cerussite (<i>q.v.</i>) occasionally occurs
in the pure form, but more frequently in a state of intimate
intermixture with clay (&ldquo;lead earth,&rdquo; <i>Bleierde</i>), limestone, iron
oxides, &amp;c. (as in the ores of Nevada and Colorado), and some
times also with coal (&ldquo;black lead ore&rdquo;). All native carbonate of
lead seems to be derived from what was originally galena, which
is always present in it as an admixture. This ore, metallurgically,
was not reckoned of much value, until immense quantities of it
were discovered in Nevada and in Colorado (U.S.). The Nevada
mines are mostly grouped around the city of Eureka, where the
ore occurs in &ldquo;pockets&rdquo; disseminated at random through limestone.
The crude ore contains about 30% lead and 0.2 to 0.3%
silver. The Colorado lead district is in the Rocky Mountains, a
few miles from the source of the Arkansas river. It forms gigantic
deposits of almost constant thickness, embedded between a floor
of limestone and a roof of porphyry. Stephens&rsquo;s discovery of
the ore in 1877 was the making of the city of Leadville, which,
in 1878, within a year of its foundation, had over 10,000 inhabitants.
The Leadville ore contains from 24 to 42% lead
and 0.1 to 2% silver. In Nevada and Colorado the ore is worked
chiefly for the sake of the silver. Deposits are also worked at
Broken Hill, New South Wales.</p>

<p>Anglesite, or lead sulphate, PbSO<span class="su">4</span>, is poor in silver, and is only
exceptionally mined by itself; it occurs in quantity in France,
Spain, Sardinia and Australia. Of other lead minerals we may
mention the basic sulphate lanarkite, PbO¬∑PbSO<span class="su">4</span>; leadhillite,
PbSO<span class="su">4</span>¬∑3PbCO<span class="su">3</span>; the basic chlorides matlockite, PbO¬∑PbCl<span class="su">2</span>,
and mendipite, PbCl<span class="su">2</span>¬∑2PbO; the chloro-phosphate pyromorphite,
PbCl<span class="su">2</span>¬∑3Pb<span class="su">3</span>(PO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, the chloro-arsenate mimetesite,
PbCl<span class="su">2</span>¬∑3Pb<span class="su">3</span>(AsO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span>; the molybdate wulfenite, PbMoO<span class="su">4</span>; the
chromate crocoite or crocoisite, PbCrO<span class="su">4</span>; the tungstate stolzite,
PbWO<span class="su">4</span>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Production.</i>&mdash;At the beginning of the 19th century the bulk of the
world&rsquo;s supply of lead was obtained from England and Spain, the
former contributing about 17,000 tons and the latter 10,000 tons
annually. Germany, Austria, Hungary, France, Russia and the
United States began to rank as producers during the second and
third decades; Belgium entered in about 1840; Italy in the &rsquo;sixties;
Mexico, Canada, Japan and Greece in the &rsquo;eighties; while Australia
assumed importance in 1888 with a production of about 18,000 tons,
although it had contributed small and varying amounts for many
preceding decades. In 1850 England headed the list of producers
with about 66,000 tons; this amount had declined in 1872 to 61,000
tons. Since this date, it has, on the whole, diminished, although
large outputs occurred in isolated years, for instance, a production
of 40,000 tons in 1893 was followed by 60,000 tons in 1896 and
40,000 in 1897. The output in 1900 was 35,000 tons, and in 1905,
25,000 tons. Spain ranked second in 1850 with about 47,000 tons;
this was increased in 1863, 1876 and in 1888 to 84,000, 127,000 and
187,000 tons respectively; but the maximum outputs mentioned
were preceded and succeeded by periods of depression. In 1900 the
production was 176,000 tons, and in 1905, 179,000 tons. The
United States, which ranked third with a production of 20,000 tons
in 1850, maintained this annual yield, until 1870, when it began to
increase; the United States now ranks as the chief producer; in
1900 the output was 253,000 tons, and in 1905, 319,744 tons. Germany
has likewise made headway; an output of 12,000 tons in
1850 being increased to 120,000 tons in 1900 and to 152,590 in 1905.
This country now ranks third, having passed England in 1873.
Mexico increased its production from 18,000 tons in 1883 to 83,000
tons in 1900 and about 88,000 tons in 1905. The Australian production
of 18,000 tons in 1888 was increased to 58,000 tons in 1891,
a value maintained until 1893, when a depression set in, only 21,000
tons being produced in 1897; prosperity then returned, and in
1898 the yield was 68,000 tons, and in 1905, 120,000 tons. Canada
became important in 1895 with a production of 10,000 tons; this
increased to 28,654 tons in 1900; and in 1905 the yield was 25,391
tons. Italy has been a fairly steady producer; the output in 1896
was 20,000 tons, and in 1905, 25,000 tons.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Metallurgy.</i></p>

<p>The extraction of the metal from pure (or nearly pure) galena
is the simplest of all metallurgical operations. The ore is roasted
(<i>i.e.</i> heated in the presence of atmospheric oxygen) until all
the sulphur is burned away and the lead left. This simple statement,
however, correctly formulates only the final result. The
first effect of the roasting is the elimination of sulphur as sulphur-dioxide,
with formation of oxide and sulphate of lead. In
practice this oxidation process is continued until the whole of the
oxygen is as nearly as possible equal in weight to the sulphur
present as sulphide or as sulphate, <i>i.e.</i> in the ratio S : O<span class="su">2</span>. The
heat is then raised in (relative) absence of air, when the two
elements named unite into sulphur-dioxide, while a regulus
of molten lead remains. Lead ores are smelted in the reverberatory
furnace, the ore-hearth, and the blast-furnace. The
use of the first two is restricted, as they are suited only for
galena ores or mixtures of galena and carbonate, which contain
not less than 58% lead and not more than 4% silica; further,
ores to be treated in the ore-hearth should run low in or be
free from silver, as the loss in the fumes is excessive. In the
blast-furnace all lead ores are successfully smelted. Blast-furnace
treatment has therefore become more general than any
other.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Three types of reverberatory  practice are in vogue&mdash;the English,
Carinthian and Silesian. In Wales and the south of England the
process is conducted in a reverberatory furnace, the sole of which is
paved with slags from previous operations, and has a depression in
the middle where the metal formed collects to be let off by a tap-hole.
The dressed ore is introduced through a &ldquo;hopper&rdquo; at the top, and
exposed to a moderate oxidizing flame until a certain proportion of
ore is oxidized, openings at the side enabling the workmen to stir
up the ore so as to constantly renew the surface exposed to the air.
At this stage as a rule some rich slags of a former operation are added
and a quantity of quicklime is incorporated, the chief object of
which is to diminish the fluidity of the mass in the next stage,
which consists in this, that, with closed air-holes, the heat is
raised so as to cause the oxide and sulphate on the one hand and
the sulphide on the other to reduce each other to metal. The lead
produced runs into the hollow and is tapped off. The roasting
process is then resumed, to be followed by another reduction, and
so on.</p>

<p>A similar process is used in Carinthia; only the furnaces are
smaller and of a somewhat different form. They are long and
narrow; the sole is plane, but slopes from the fire-bridge towards
the flue, so that the metal runs to the latter end to collect in pots
placed <i>outside</i> the furnace. In Carinthia the oxidizing process from
the first is pushed on so far that metallic lead begins to show, and the
oxygen introduced predominates over the sulphur left. The mass is
then stirred to liberate the lead, which is removed as <i>R√ºhrblei</i>.
Charcoal is now added, and the heat urged on to obtain <i>Pressblei</i>,
an inferior metal formed partly by the action of the charcoal on the
oxide of lead. The fuel used is fir-wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span></p>

<p>The Silesian furnace has an oblong hearth sloping from the fire-bridge
to the flue-bridge. This causes the lead to collect at the
coolest part of the hearth, whence it is tapped, &amp;c., as in the English
furnace. While by the English and Carinthian processes as much
lead as possible is extracted in the furnace, with the Silesian method
a very low temperature is used, thus taking out about one-half of
the lead and leaving very rich slags (50% lead) to be smelted in
the blast-furnace, the ultimate result being a very much higher yield
than by either of the other processes. The loss in lead by the
combined reverberatory and blast-furnace treatment is only 3.2%.</p>

<p>In Cumberland, Northumberland, Durham and latterly the United
States, the reverberatory furnace is used only for roasting the ore,
and the oxidized ore is then reduced by fusion in a low, square blast-furnace
(a &ldquo;Scottish hearth furnace&rdquo;) lined with cast iron, as is
also the inclined sole-plate which is made to project beyond the
furnace, the outside portion (the &ldquo;work-stone&rdquo;) being provided with
grooves guiding any molten metal that may be placed on the
&ldquo;stone&rdquo; into a cast iron pot; the &ldquo;tuy√®re&rdquo; for the introduction
of the wind was, in the earlier types, about half way down the
furnace.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to the melting process, the &ldquo;browse&rdquo; left in the
preceding operation (half-fused and imperfectly reduced ore) is
introduced with some peat and coal, and heated with the help of
the blast. It is then raked out on the work-stone and divided into
a very poor &ldquo;grey&rdquo; slag which is put aside, and a richer portion,
which goes back into the furnace. Some of the roasted ore is strewed
upon it, and, after a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s working, the whole is taken
out on the work-stone, where the lead produced runs off. The
&ldquo;browse,&rdquo; after removal of the &ldquo;grey&rdquo; slag, is reintroduced, ore
added, and, after a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s heating, the mass again
placed on the work-stone, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the more recent form of the hearth process the blocks of cast
iron forming the sides and back of the Scottish furnace are now
generally replaced in the United States by water-cooled shells (water-jackets)
of cast iron. In this way continuous working has been
rendered possible, whereas formerly operations had to be stopped
every twelve or fifteen hours to allow the over-heated blocks and
furnace to cool down. A later improvement (which somewhat
changes the mode of working) is that by Moffett. While he also
prevents interruption of the operation by means of water-jackets,
he uses hot-blast, and produces, besides metallic lead, large volumes
of lead fumes which are drawn off by fans through long cooling
tubes, and then forced through suspended bags which filter off the
dust, called &ldquo;blue powder.&rdquo; Thus, a mixture of lead sulphate
(45%) and oxide (44%) with some sulphide (8%), zinc and carbonaceous
matter, is agglomerated by a heap-roast and then smelted
in a slag-eye furnace with grey slag from the ore-hearth. The
furnace has, in addition to the usual tuy√®res near the bottom, a
second set near the throat in order to effect a complete oxidation of
all combustible matter. Much fume is thus produced. This is
drawn off, cooled and filtered, and forms a white paint of good body,
consisting of about 65% lead sulphate, 26% lead oxide, 6% zinc
oxide and 3% other substances. Thus in the Moffett method it is
immaterial whether metal or fume is produced, as in either case it is
saved and the price is about the same.</p>

<p>In smelting at once in the same blast-furnace ores of different
character, the old use of separate processes of precipitation, roasting
and reduction, and general reduction prevailing in the Harz Mountains,
Freiberg and other places, to suit local conditions, has been
abandoned. Ores are smelted raw if the fall of matte (metallic
sulphide) does not exceed 5%; otherwise they are subjected to a
preliminary oxidizing roast to expel the sulphur, unless they run too
high in silver, say 100 oz. to the ton, when they are smelted raw.
The leading reverberatory furnace for roasting lead-bearing sulphide
ores has a level hearth 14-16 ft. wide and 60-80 ft. long. It puts
through 9-12 tons of ore in twenty-four hours, reducing the percentage
of sulphur to 2-4%, and requires four to six men and about 2
tons of coal. In many instances it has been replaced by mechanical
furnaces, which are now common in roasting sulphide copper ores
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sulphuric Acid</a></span>). A modern blast-furnace is oblong in horizontal
section and about 24 ft. high from furnace floor to feed floor.
The shaft, resting upon arches supported by four cast iron columns
about 9 ft. high, is usually of brick, red brick on the outside, fire-brick
on the inside; sometimes it is made of wrought iron water-jackets.
The smelting zone always has a bosh and a contracted
tuy√®re section. It is enclosed by water-jackets, which are usually
cast iron, sometimes mild steel. The hearth always has an Arents
siphon tap. This is an inclined channel running through the side-wall,
beginning near the bottom of the crucible and ending at the
top of the hearth, where it is enlarged into a basin. The crucible
and the channel form the two limbs of an inverted siphon. While
the furnace is running the crucible and channel remain filled with
lead; all the lead reduced to the metallic state in smelting collects
in the crucible, and rising in the channel, overflows into the basin,
whence it is removed. The slag and matte formed float upon the
lead in the crucible and are tapped, usually together, at intervals
into slag-pots, where the heavy matter settles on the bottom and
the light slag on the top. When cold they are readily separated by
a blow from a hammer. The following table gives the dimensions
of some well-known American lead-furnaces.</p>

<p>A furnace, 42 by 120 in. at the tuy√®res, with a working height of
17-20 ft., will put through in twenty-four hours, with twelve men,
12% coke and 2 &#8468; blast-pressure, 85-100 tons average charge, <i>i.e.</i>
one that is a medium coarse, contains 12-15% lead, not over 5%
zinc, and makes under 5% matte. In making up a charge, the ores
and fluxes, whose chemical compositions have been determined,
are mixed so as to form out of the components not to be reduced
to the metallic or sulphide state, typical slags (silicates of ferrous
and calcium oxides, incidentally of aluminium oxide, which have
been found to do successful work). Such slags contain SiO<span class="su">2</span> = 30-33%,
Fe(Mn)O = 27-50%, Ca(Mg, Ba)O = 12-28%, and retain less
than 1% lead and 1 oz. silver to the ton. The leading products of
the blast-furnace are argentiferous lead (base bullion), matte, slag
and flue-dust (fine particles of charge and volatilized metal carried
out of the furnace by the ascending gas current). The base bullion
(assaying 300 ¬± oz. per ton) is desilverized (see below); the matte
(Pb = 8-12%, Cu = 3-4%, Ag = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>-<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> of the assay-value of the base
bullion, rest Fe and S) is roasted and resmelted, when part of the
argentiferous lead is recovered as base bullion, while the rest remains
with the copper, which becomes concentrated in a copper-matte
(60% copper) to be worked up by separate processes. The slag is
a waste product, and the flue-dust, collected by special devices in
dust-chambers, is briquetted by machinery, with lime as a bond,
and then resmelted with the ore-charge. The yield in lead is over
90%, in silver over 97% and in gold 100%. The cost of smelting
a ton of ore in Colorado in a single furnace, 42 by 120 in. at the
tuy√®res, is about $3.</p>

<p>The lead produced in the reverberatory furnace and the ore-hearth
is of a higher grade than that produced in the blast-furnace, as the
ores treated are purer and richer, and the reducing action
is less powerful. The following analysis of blast-furnace
<span class="sidenote">Refining.</span>
lead of Freiberg, Saxony, is from an exceptionally impure lead:
Pb = 95.088, Ag = 0.470, Bi = 0.019, Cu = 0.225, As = 1.826, Sb = 0.958,
Sn = 1.354, Fe = 0.007, Zn = 0.002, S = 0.051. Of the impurities,
most of the copper, nickel and copper, considerable arsenic, some
antimony and small amounts of silver are removed by liquation.
The lead is melted down slowly, when the impurities separate in the
form of a scum (dross), which is easily removed. The purification
by liquation is assisted by poling the lead when it is below redness.
A stick of green wood is forced into it, and the vapours and gases
set free expose new surfaces to the air, which at this temperature
has only a mildly oxidizing effect. The pole, the use of which is
awkward, has been replaced by dry stream, which has a similar
effect. To remove tin, arsenic and antimony, the lead has to be
brought up to a bright-red heat, when the air has a strongly oxidizing
effect. Tin is removed mainly as a powdery mixture of stannate
of lead and lead oxide, arsenic and antimony as a slagged mixture
of arsenate and antimonate of lead and lead oxide. They are readily
withdrawn from the surface of the lead, and are worked up into
antimony (arsenic)&mdash;tin-lead and antimony-lead alloys. Liquation,
if not followed by poling, is carried on as a rule in a reverberatory
furnace with an oblong, slightly trough-shaped inclined hearth;
if the lead is to be poled it is usually melted down in a cast-iron kettle.
If the lead is to be liquated and then brought to a bright-red heat,
both operations are carried on in the same reverberatory furnace.
This has an oblong, dish-shaped hearth of acid or basic fire-brick
built into a wrought-iron pan, which rests on transverse rails supported
by longitudinal walls. The lead is melted down at a low
temperature and drossed. The temperature is then raised, and the
scum which forms on the surface is withdrawn until pure litharge
forms, which only takes place after all the tin, arsenic and antimony
have been eliminated.</p>

<p>Silver is extracted from lead by means of the process of cupellation.
Formerly all argentiferous lead had to be cupelled, and the resulting
litharge then reduced to metallic lead. In 1833 Pattinson
invented his process by means of which practically all the
<span class="sidenote">Desilverizing.</span>
silver is concentrated in 13% of the original lead to be
cupelled, while the rest becomes market lead. In 1842 Karsten
discovered that lead could be desilverized by means of zinc. His
invention, however, only took practical form in 1850-1852 through
the researches of Parkes, who showed how the zinc-silver-lead alloy
formed could be worked and the desilverized lead freed from the zinc
it had taken up. In the Parkes process only 5% of the original lead
need be cupelled. Thus, while cupellation still furnishes the only
means for the final separation of lead and silver, it has become an
auxiliary process to the two methods of concentration given. Of
these the Pattinson process has become subordinate to the Parkes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>317</span>
process, as it is more expensive and leaves more silver and impurities
in the market lead. It holds its own, however, when base
bullion contains bismuth in appreciable amounts, as in the Pattinson
process bismuth follows the lead to be cupelled, while in the Parkes
process it remains with the desilverized lead which goes to market,
and lead of commerce should contain little bismuth. At Freiberg,
Saxony, the two processes have been combined. The base bullion
is imperfectly Pattinsonized, giving lead rich in silver and bismuth,
which is cupelled, and lead low in silver, and especially so in bismuth,
which is further desilverized by the Parkes process.</p>

<p>The effect of the two processes on the purity of the market lead
is clearly shown by the two following analyses by Hampe, which
represent lead from Lautenthal in the Harz Mountains, where the
Parkes process replaced that of Pattinson, the ores and smelting
process remaining practically the same:&mdash;</p>

<p>The reverberatory furnace commonly used for cupelling goes by
the name of the English cupelling furnace. It is oblong, and has a
fixed roof and a movable iron hearth (test). Formerly
the test was lined with bone-ash; at present the hearth
<span class="sidenote">Cupelling.</span>
material is a mixture of crushed limestone and clay (3:1) or Portland
cement, either alone or mixed with crushed fire-brick; in a few
instances the lining has been made of burnt magnesite. In the beginning
of the operation enough argentiferous lead is charged to fill
the cavity of the test. After it has been melted down and brought
to a red heat, the blast, admitted at the back, oxidizes the lead and
drives the litharge formed towards the front, where it is run off. At
the same time small bars of argentiferous lead, inserted at the back,
are slowly pushed forward, so that in melting down they may replace
the oxidized lead. Thus the level of the lead is kept approximately
constant, and the silver becomes concentrated in the lead. In large
works the silver-lead alloy is removed when it contains 60-80%
silver, and the cupellation of the rich bullion from several concentration
furnaces is finished in a second furnace. At the same time
the silver is brought to the required degree of fineness, usually by the
use of nitre. In small works the cupellation is finished in one furnace,
and the resulting low-grade silver fined in a plumbago crucible,
either by overheating in the presence of air, or by the addition of
silver sulphate to the melted silver, when air or sulphur trioxide and
oxygen oxidize the impurities. The lead charged contains about
1.5% lead if it comes from a Pattinson plant, from 5-10% if from
a Parkes plant. In a test 7 ft. by 4 ft. 10 in. and 4 in. deep, about
6 tons of lead are cupelled in twenty-four hours. A furnace is served
by three men, working in eight-hour shifts, and requires about
2 tons of coal, which corresponds to about 110 gallons reduced oil,
air being used as atomizer. The loss in lead is about 5%. The
latest cupelling furnaces have the general form of a reverberatory
copper-smelting furnace. The working door through which the
litharge is run off lies under the flue which carries off the products
of combustion and the lead fumes, the lead is charged and the blast
is admitted near the fire-bridge.</p>

<p>In the <i>Pattinson</i> process the argentiferous lead is melted down in
the central cast iron kettle of a series 8-15, placed one next to the
other, each having a capacity of 9-15 tons and a separate
fire-place. The crystals of impoverished lead which fall
<span class="sidenote">Pattinson process.</span>
to the bottom, upon coaling the charge, are taken out
with a skimmer and discharged into the neighbouring kettle (say
to the right) until about two-thirds of the original charge has been
removed; then the liquid enriched lead is ladled into the kettle on
the opposite side. To the kettle, two-thirds full of crystals of lead,
is now added lead of the same tenor in silver, the whole is liquefied,
and the cooling, crystallizing, skimming and ladling are repeated.
The same is done with the kettle one-third filled with liquid lead,
and so on until the first kettle contains market lead, the last cupelling
lead. The intervening kettles contain leads with silver contents
ranging from above market to below cupelling lead. The original
Pattinson process has been in many cases replaced by the Luce-Rozan
process (1870), which does away with arduous labour and
attains a more satisfactory crystallization. The plant consists of
two tilting oval metal pans (capacity 7 tons), one cylindrical crystallizing
pot (capacity 22 tons), with two discharging spouts and one
steam inlet opening, two lead moulds (capacity 3¬Ω tons), and a steam
crane. Pans and pot are heated from separate fire-places. Supposing
the pot to be filled with melted lead to be treated, the fire is withdrawn
beneath and steam introduced. This cools and stirs the
lead when crystals begin to form. As soon as two-thirds of the lead
has separated in the form of crystals, the steam is shut off and the
liquid lead drained off through the two spouts into the moulds. The
fire underneath the pot is again started, the crystals are liquefied, and
one of the two pans, filled with melted lead, is tilted by means of the
crane and its contents poured into the pot. In the meantime the lead
in the moulds, which has solidified, is removed with the crane and
stacked to one side, until its turn comes to be raised and charged into
one of the pans. The crystallization proper lasts one hour, the working
of a charge four hours, six charges being run in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary for the success of the <i>Parkes</i> process
that the zinc and lead should contain only a small amount of impurity.
The spelter used must therefore be of a good
grade, and the lead is usually first refined in a reverberatory
<span class="sidenote">Parkes process.</span>
furnace (the softening furnace). The capacity
of the furnace must be 10% greater than that of the kettle into
which the softened lead is tapped, as the dross and skimmings
formed amount to about 10% of the weight of the lead charged.
The kettle is spherical, and is suspended over a fire-place by a broad
rim resting on a wall; it is usually of cast iron. Most kettles at
present hold 30 tons of lead; some, however, have double that
capacity. When zinc is placed on the lead (heated to above the
melting-point of zinc), liquefied and brought into intimate contact
with the lead by stirring, gold, copper, silver and lead will combine
with the zinc in the order given. By beginning with a small amount
of zinc, all the gold and copper and some silver and lead will be
alloyed with the zinc to a so-called gold&mdash;or copper&mdash;crust, and the
residual lead saturated with zinc. By removing from the surface
of the lead this first crust and working it up separately (liquating,
retorting and cupelling), dor√© silver is obtained. By the second
addition of zinc most of the silver will be collected in a saturated
zinc-silver-lead crust, which, when worked up, gives fine silver.
A third addition becomes necessary to remove the rest of the silver,
when the lead will assay only 0.1 oz. silver per ton. As this complete
desilverization is only possible by the use of an excess of zinc,
the unsaturated zinc-silver-lead alloy is put aside to form part
of the second zincking of the next following charge. In skimming
the crust from the surface of the lead some unalloyed lead is also
drawn off, and has to be separated by an additional operation
(liquation), as, running lower in silver than the crust, it would otherwise
reduce its silver content and increase the amount of lead to be
cupelled. A zincking takes 5-6 hours; 1.5-2.5% zinc is required
for desilverizing. The liquated zinc-silver-lead crust contains
5-10% silver, 30-40% zinc and 65-50% lead. Before it can be
cupelled it has to be freed from most of the zinc, which is accomplished
by distilling in a retort made of a mixture similar to that of
the plumbago crucible. The retort is pear-shaped, and holds
1000-1500 lb of charge, consisting of liquated crust mixed with 1-3%
of charcoal. The condenser commonly used is an old retort. The
distillation of 1000 &#8468; charge lasts 5-6 hours, requires 500-600 &#8468;
coke or 30¬± gallons reduced oil, and yields about 10% metallic
zinc and 1% blue powder&mdash;a mixture of finely-divided metallic zinc
and zinc oxide. About 60% of the zinc used in desilverizing is
recovered in a form to be used again. One man serves 2-4 retorts.
The desilverized lead, which retains 0.6-0.7% zinc, has to be refined
before it is suited for industrial use. The operation is carried on in
a reverberatory furnace or in a kettle. In the reverberatory furnace,
similar to the one used in softening, the lead is brought to a bright-red
heat and air allowed to have free access. The zinc and some lead
are oxidized; part of the zinc passes off with the fumes, part is dissolved
by the litharge, forming a melted mixture which is skimmed
off and reduced in a blast-furnace or a reverberatory smelting furnace.
In the kettle covered with a hood the zinc is oxidized by means of
dry steam, and incidentally some lead by the air which cannot be
completely excluded. A yellowish powdery mixture of zinc and lead
oxides collects on the lead; it is skimmed off and sold as paint.
From the reverberatory furnace or the kettle the refined lead is
siphoned off into a storage (market) kettle after it has cooled somewhat,
and from this it is siphoned off into moulds placed in a semi-circle
on the floor. In the process the yield in metal, based upon
the charge in the kettle, is lead 99%, silver 100+%, gold 98-100%.
The plus-silver is due to the fact that in assaying the base bullion
by cupellation, the silver lost by volatilization and cupel-absorption
is neglected. In the United States the cost of desilverizing a ton
base bullion is about $6.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Properties of Lead.</i>&mdash;Pure lead is a feebly lustrous bluish-white
metal, endowed with a characteristically high degree of
softness and plasticity, and almost entirely devoid of elasticity.
Its breaking strain is very small: a wire <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span>th in. thick is
ruptured by a charge of about 30 &#8468;. The specific gravity is
11.352 for ingot, and from 11.354 to 11.365 for sheet lead (water
of 4¬∞C. = 1). The expansion of unit-length from 0¬∞C. to to 100¬∞C.
is .002948 (Fizeau). The conductivity for heat (Wiedemann and
Franz) or electricity is 8.5, that of silver being taken as 100.
It melts at 327.7¬∞C. (H. L. Callendar); at a bright-red heat
it perceptibly vapourizes, and boils at a temperature between
1450¬∞ and 1600¬∞. The specific heat is .0314 (Regnault). Lead
exposed to ordinary air is rapidly tarnished, but the thin dark
film formed is very slow in increasing. When kept fused in the
presence of air lead readily takes up oxygen, with the formation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>
at first of a dark-coloured scum, and then of monoxide PbO,
the rate of oxidation increasing with the temperature.</p>

<p>Water when absolutely pure has no action on lead, but in the
presence of air the lead is quickly attacked, with formation
of the hydrate, Pb(OH)<span class="su">2</span>, which is appreciably soluble in water
forming an alkaline liquid. When carbonic acid is present the
dissolved oxide is soon precipitated as basic carbonate, so that the
corrosion of the lead becomes continuous. Since all soluble lead
compounds are strong cumulative poisons, danger is involved
in using lead cisterns or pipes in the distribution of <i>pure</i> waters.
The word &ldquo;pure&rdquo; is emphasized because experience shows
that the presence in a water of even small proportions of calcium
bicarbonate or sulphate prevents its action on lead. All impurities
do not act in a similar way. Ammonium nitrate and
nitrite, for instance, intensify the action of a water on lead. Even
pure waters, however, such as that of Loch Katrine (which
forms the Glasgow supply), act so slowly, at least on such lead
pipes as have already been in use for some time, that there is no
danger in using short lead service pipes even for them, if the taps
are being constantly used. Lead cisterns must be unhesitatingly
condemned.</p>

<p>The presence of carbonic acid in a water does not affect its
action on lead. Aqueous non-oxidizing acids generally have
little or no action on lead in the absence of air. Dilute sulphuric
acid (say an acid of 20% H<span class="su">2</span>SO<span class="su">4</span> or less) has no action on lead
even when air is present, nor on boiling. Strong acid does act, the
more so the greater its concentration and the higher its temperature.
Pure lead is far more readily corroded than a metal contaminated
with 1% or even less of antimony or copper. Boiling
concentrated sulphuric acid converts lead into sulphate, with
evolution of sulphur dioxide. Dilute nitric acid readily dissolves
the metal, with formation of nitrate Pb(NO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lead Alloys.</i>&mdash;Lead, unites readily with almost all other
metals; hence, and on account of its being used for the extraction
of (for instance) silver, its alchemistic name of <i>saturnus</i>.
Of the alloys the following may be named:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>With Antimony.</i>&mdash;Lead contaminated with small proportions of
antimony is more highly proof against sulphuric acid than the pure
metal. An alloy of 83 parts of lead and 17 of antimony is used as
type metal; other proportions are used, however, and other metals
added besides antimony (<i>e.g.</i> tin, bismuth) to give the alloy certain
properties.</p>

<p><i>Arsenic</i> renders lead harder. An alloy made by addition of about
<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">56</span>th of arsenic has been used for making shot.</p>

<p><i>Bismuth and Antimony.</i>&mdash;An alloy consisting of 9 parts of lead,
2 of antimony and 2 of bismuth is used for stereotype plates.</p>

<p><i>Bismuth and Tin.</i>&mdash;These triple alloys are noted for their low
fusing points. An alloy of 5 of lead, 8 of bismuth and 3 of tin
fuses at 94.4¬∞C, <i>i.e.</i> below the boiling-point of water (Rose&rsquo;s metal).
An alloy of 15 parts of bismuth, 8 of lead, 4 of tin and 3 of cadmium
(Wood&rsquo;s alloy) melts below 70¬∞C.</p>

<p><i>Tin</i> unites with lead in any proportion with slight expansion, the
alloy fusing at a lower temperature than either component. It is
used largely for soldering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pewter&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>) may be said to be substantially an alloy of the
same two metals, but small quantities of copper, antimony and zinc
are frequently added.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Compounds of Lead.</i></p>

<p>Lead generally functions as a divalent element of distinctly
metallic character, yielding a definite series of salts derived
from the oxide PbO. At the same time, however, it forms a
number of compounds in which it is most decidedly tetravalent;
and thus it shows relations to carbon, silicon, germanium and tin.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Oxides.</i>&mdash;Lead combines with oxygen to form five oxides, viz.
Pb<span class="su">2</span>O, PbO, PbO<span class="su">2</span>, Pb<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span> and Pb<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">4</span>. The <i>suboxide</i>, Pb<span class="su">2</span>O, is the
first product of the oxidation of lead, and is also obtained as a black
powder by heating lead oxalate to 300¬∞ out of contact with air.
It ignites when heated in air with the formation of the monoxide;
dilute acids convert it into metallic lead and lead monoxide, the latter
dissolving in the acid. The <i>monoxide</i>, PbO, occurs in nature as the
mineral <i>lead ochre</i>. This oxide is produced by heating lead in contact
with air and removing the film of oxide as formed. It is manufactured
in two forms, known as &ldquo;massicot&rdquo; and &ldquo;litharge.&rdquo;
The former is produced at temperatures below, the latter at temperatures
above the fusing-point of the oxide. The liquid litharge when
allowed to cool solidifies into a hard stone-like mass, which, however,
when left to itself, soon crumbles up into a heap of resplendent
dark yellow scales known as &ldquo;flake litharge.&rdquo; &ldquo;Buff&rdquo; or &ldquo;levigated
litharge&rdquo; is prepared by grinding the larger pieces under
water. Litharge is much used for the preparation of lead salts, for
the manufacture of oil varnishes, of certain cements, and of lead
plaster, and for other purposes. Massicot is the raw material for
the manufacture of &ldquo;red lead&rdquo; or &ldquo;minium.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lead monoxide is dimorphous, occurring as cubical dodecahedra
and as rhombic octahedra. Its specific gravity is about 9; it is
sparingly soluble in water, but readily dissolves in acids and molten
alkalis. A yellow and red modification have been described (<i>Zeit.
anorg. Chem.</i>, 1906, 50, p. 265). The corresponding <i>hydrate</i>, Pb(OH)<span class="su">2</span>,
is obtained as a white crystalline precipitate by adding ammonia
to a solution of lead nitrate or acetate. It dissolves in an excess
of alkali to form <i>plumbites</i> of the general formula Pb(OM)<span class="su">2</span>. It
absorbs carbon dioxide from the air when moist. A hydrated oxide,
2PbO¬∑H<span class="su">2</span>O, is obtained when a solution of the monoxide in potash
is treated with carbon dioxide.</p>

<p><i>Lead dioxide</i>, PbO<span class="su">2</span>, also known as &ldquo;puce oxide,&rdquo; occurs in nature
as the mineral plattnerite, and may be most conveniently prepared
by heating mixed solutions of lead acetate and bleaching powder
until the original precipitate blackens. The solution is filtered, the
precipitate well washed, and, generally, is put up in the form of a
paste in well-closed vessels. It is also obtained by passing chlorine
into a suspension of lead oxide or carbonate, or of magnesia and
lead sulphate, in water; or by treating the sesquioxide or red oxide
with nitric acid. The formation of lead dioxide by the electrolysis
of a lead solution, the anode being a lead plate coated with lead
oxide or sulphate and the cathode a lead plate, is the fundamental
principle of the storage cell (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Accumulator</a></span>). Heating or exposure
to sunlight reduces it to the red oxide; it fires when ground
with sulphur, and oxidizes ammonia to nitric acid, with the simultaneous
formation of ammonium nitrate. It oxidizes a manganese
salt (free from chlorine) in the presence of nitric acid to a permanganate;
this is a very delicate test for manganese. It forms
crystallizable salts with potassium and calcium hydrates, and
functions as a weak acid forming salts named plumbates. The
Kassner process for the manufacture of oxygen depends upon the
formation of calcium plumbate, Ca<span class="su">2</span>PbO<span class="su">4</span>, by heating a mixture of
lime and litharge in a current of air, decomposing this substance into
calcium carbonate and lead dioxide by heating in a current of
carbon dioxide, and then decomposing these compounds with the
evolution of carbon dioxide and oxygen by raising the temperature.
<i>Plumbic acid</i>, PbO(OH)<span class="su">2</span>, is obtained as a bluish-black, lustrous
body of electrolysing an alkaline solution of lead sodium tartrate.</p>

<p><i>Tetravalent Lead.</i>&mdash;If a suspension of lead dichloride in hydrochloric
acid be treated with chlorine gas, a solution of lead tetrachloride
is obtained; by adding ammonium chloride ammonium
plumbichloride, (NH<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span>PbCl<span class="su">6</span>, is precipitated, which on treatment
with strong sulphuric acid yields <i>lead tetrachloride</i>, PbCl<span class="su">4</span>, as a translucent,
yellow, highly refractive liquid. It freezes at -15¬∞ to a
yellowish crystalline mass; on heating it loses chlorine and forms
lead dichloride. With water it forms a hydrate, and ultimately decomposes
into lead dioxide and hydrochloric acid. It combines with
alkaline chlorides&mdash;potassium, rubidium and caesium&mdash;to form
crystalline <i>plumbichlorides</i>; it also forms a crystalline compound
with quinoline. By dissolving red lead, Pb<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">4</span>, in glacial acetic acid
and crystallizing the filtrate, colourless monoclinic prisms of lead
tetracetate, Pb(C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">4</span>, are obtained. This salt gives the corresponding
chloride and fluoride with hydrochloric and hydrofluoric
acids, and the phosphate, Pb(HPO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, with phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>These salts are like those of tin; and the resemblance to this metal
is clearly enhanced by the study of the alkyl compounds. Here
compounds of divalent lead have not yet been obtained; by acting
with zinc ethide on lead chloride, <i>lead tetraethide</i>, Pb(C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">4</span>, is obtained,
with the separation of metallic lead.</p>

<p><i>Lead sesquioxide</i>, Pb<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>, is obtained as a reddish-yellow amorphous
powder by carefully adding sodium hypochlorite to a cold potash
solution of lead oxide, or by adding very dilute ammonia to a
solution of red lead in acetic acid. It is decomposed by acids into
a mixture of lead monoxide and dioxide, and may thus be regarded
as lead metaplumbate, PbPbO<span class="su">3</span>. <i>Red lead</i> or <i>triplumbic tetroxide</i>,
Pb<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">4</span>, is a scarlet crystalline powder of specific gravity 8.6-9.1,
obtained by roasting very finely divided pure massicot or lead carbonate;
the brightness of the colour depends in a great measure on
the roasting. Pliny mentions it under the name of <i>minium</i>, but
it was confused with cinnabar and the red arsenic sulphide; Dioscorides
mentions its preparation from white lead or lead carbonate.
On heating it assumes a finer colour, but then turns violet and
finally black; regaining, however, its original colour on cooling.
On ignition, it loses oxygen and forms litharge. Commercial red
lead is frequently contaminated with this oxide, which may, however,
be removed by repeated digestion with lead acetate. Its common
adulterants are iron oxides, powdered barytes and brick dust.
Acids decompose it into lead dioxide and monoxide, and the latter
may or may not dissolve to form a salt; red lead may, therefore,
be regarded as <i>lead orthoplumbate</i>, Pb<span class="su">2</span>PbO<span class="su">4</span>. It is chiefly used as a
pigment and in the manufacture of flint glass.</p>

<p><i>Lead chloride</i>, PbCl<span class="su">2</span>, occurs in nature as the mineral cotunnite,
which crystallizes in the rhombic system, and is found in the neighbourhood
of volcanic craters. It is artificially obtained by adding
hydrochloric acid to a solution of lead salt, as a white precipitate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>319</span>
little soluble in cold water, less so in dilute hydrochloric acid, more
so in the strong acid, and readily soluble in hot water, from which
on cooling, the excess of dissolved salt separates out in silky rhombic
needles. It melts at 485¬∞ and solidifies on cooling to a translucent,
horn-like mass; an early name for it was <i>plumbum corneum</i>, horn
lead. A basic chloride, Pb(OH)Cl, was introduced in 1849 by
Pattinson as a substitute for white lead. Powdered galena is dissolved
in hot hydrochloric acid, the solution allowed to cool and the
deposit of impure lead chloride washed with cold water to remove
iron and copper. The residue is then dissolved in hot water, filtered,
and the clear solution is mixed with very thin milk of lime so adjusted
that it takes out one-half of the chlorine of the PbCl<span class="su">2</span>. The oxychloride
comes down as an amorphous white precipitate. Another
oxychloride, PbCl<span class="su">2</span>¬∑7PbO, known as &ldquo;Cassel yellow,&rdquo; was prepared
by Vauquelin by fusing pure oxide, PbO, with one-tenth of its weight
of sal ammoniac. &ldquo;Turner&rsquo;s yellow&rdquo; or &ldquo;patent yellow&rdquo; is another
artificially prepared oxychloride, used as a pigment. Mendipite and
matlockite are mineral oxychlorides.</p>

<p><i>Lead, fluoride</i>, PbF<span class="su">2</span>, is a white powder obtained by precipitating
a lead salt with a soluble fluoride; it is sparingly soluble in water
but readily dissolves in hydrochloric and nitric acids. A chloro-fluoride,
PbClF, is obtained by adding sodium fluoride to a solution
of lead chloride. Lead bromide, PbBr<span class="su">2</span>, a white solid, and lead
iodide, PbI<span class="su">2</span>, a yellow solid, are prepared by precipitating a lead
salt with a soluble bromide or iodide; they resemble the chloride in
solubility.</p>

<p><i>Lead carbonate</i>, PbCO<span class="su">3</span>, occurs in nature as the mineral cerussite
(<i>q.v.</i>). It is produced by the addition of a solution of lead salt to an
excess of ammonium carbonate, as an almost insoluble white precipitate.
Of greater practical importance is a basic carbonate,
substantially 2PbCO<span class="su">3</span>¬∑Pb(OH)<span class="su">2</span>, largely used as a white pigment under
the name of &ldquo;white lead.&rdquo; This pigment is of great antiquity;
Theophrastus called it <span class="grk" title="psimythion">&#968;&#953;&#956;&#973;&#952;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, and prepared it by acting on lead
with vinegar, and Pliny, who called it <i>cerussa</i>, obtained it by dissolving
lead in vinegar and evaporating to dryness. It thus appears
that white lead and sugar of lead were undifferentiated. Geber gave
the preparation in a correct form, and T. O. Bergman proved its
composition. This pigment is manufactured by several methods.
In the old Dutch method, pieces of sheet lead are suspended in
stoneware pots so as to occupy the upper two-thirds of the vessels.
A little vinegar is poured into each pot; they are then covered with
plates of sheet lead, buried in horse-dung or spent tanner&rsquo;s bark,
and left to themselves for a considerable time. By the action of the
acetic acid and atmospheric oxygen, the lead is converted superficially
into a basic acetate, which is at once decomposed by the
carbon dioxide, with formation of white lead and acetic acid, which
latter then acts <i>de novo</i>. After a month or so the plates are converted
to a more or less considerable depth into crusts of white lead. These
are knocked off, ground up with water, freed from metal-particles
by elutriation, and the paste of white lead is allowed to set and dry
in small conical forms. The German method differs from the Dutch
inasmuch as the lead is suspended in a large chamber heated by
ordinary means, and there exposed to the simultaneous action of
vapour of aqueous acetic acid and of carbon dioxide. Another process
depends upon the formation of lead chloride by grinding together
litharge with salt and water, and then treating the alkaline fluid
with carbon dioxide until it is neutral. White lead is an earthy,
amorphous powder. The inferior varieties of commercial &ldquo;white
lead&rdquo; are produced by mixing the genuine article with more or less
of finely powdered heavy spar or occasionally zinc-white (ZnO).
Venetian white, Hamburg white and Dutch white are mixtures of one
part of white lead with one, two and three parts of barium sulphate
respectively.</p>

<p><i>Lead sulphide</i>, PbS, occurs in nature as the mineral galena (<i>q.v.</i>),
and constitutes the most valuable ore of lead. It may be artificially
prepared by leading sulphur vapour over lead, by fusing litharge
with sulphur, or, as a black precipitate, by passing sulphuretted
hydrogen into a solution of a lead salt. It dissolves in strong
nitric acid with the formation of the nitrate and sulphate, and also
in hot concentrated hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p><i>Lead sulphate</i>, PbSO<span class="su">4</span>, occurs in nature as the mineral anglesite
(<i>q.v.</i>), and may be prepared by the addition of sulphuric acid to
solutions of lead salts, as a white precipitate almost insoluble in water
(1 in 21,739), less soluble still in dilute sulphuric acid (1 in 36,504)
and insoluble in alcohol. Ammonium sulphide blackens it, and it is
coluble in solution of ammonium acetate, which distinguishes it from
barium sulphate. Strong sulphuric acid dissolves it, forming an
acid salt, Pb(HSO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, which is hydrolysed by adding water, the
normal sulphate being precipitated; hence the milkiness exhibited
by samples of oil of vitriol on dilution.</p>

<p><i>Lead nitrate</i>, Pb(NO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, is obtained by dissolving the metal or oxide
in aqueous nitric acid; it forms white crystals, difficultly soluble in
cold water, readily in hot water and almost insoluble in strong
nitric acid. It was mentioned by Libavius, who named it <i>calx
plumb dulcis</i>. It is decomposed by heat into oxide, nitrogen peroxide
and oxygen; and is used for the manufacture of fusees and other
deflagrating compounds, and also for preparing mordants in the dyeing
and calico-printing industries. Basic nitrates, <i>e.g.</i> Pb(NO<span class="su">3</span>)OH,
Pb<span class="su">3</span>O(OH)<span class="su">2</span>(NO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, Pb<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">2</span>(OH)NO<span class="su">3</span>, &amp;c., have been described.</p>

<p><i>Lead Phosphates.</i>&mdash;The normal ortho-phosphate, Pb<span class="su">3</span>(PO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, is
a white precipitate obtained by adding sodium phosphate to lead
acetate; the acid phosphate, PbHPO<span class="su">4</span>, is produced by precipitating
a boiling solution of lead nitrate with phosphoric acid; the pyrophosphate
and meta-phosphate are similar white precipitates.</p>

<p><i>Lead Borates.</i>&mdash;By fusing litharge with boron trioxide, glasses of a
composition varying with the proportions of the mixture are obtained;
some of these are used in the manufacture of glass. The
borate, Pb<span class="su">2</span>B<span class="su">6</span>O<span class="su">11</span>¬∑4H<span class="su">2</span>O, is obtained as a white precipitate by adding
borax to a lead salt; this on heating with strong ammonia gives
PbB<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">4</span>¬∑H<span class="su">2</span>¬∑O, which, in turn, when boiled with a solution of boric
acid, gives PbB<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">7</span>¬∑4H<span class="su">2</span>O.</p>

<p><i>Lead silicates</i> are obtained as glasses by fusing litharge with silica;
they play a considerable part in the manufacture of the lead glasses
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Glass</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Lead chromate</i>, PbCrO<span class="su">4</span>, is prepared industrially as a yellow
pigment, chrome yellow, by precipitating sugar of lead solution
with potassium bichromate. The beautiful yellow precipitate is
little soluble in dilute nitric acid, but soluble in caustic potash.
The vermilion-like pigment which occurs in commerce as &ldquo;chrome-red&rdquo;
is a basic chromate, Pb<span class="su">2</span>CrO<span class="su">5</span>, prepared by treating recently
precipitated normal chromate with a properly adjusted proportion
of caustic soda, or by boiling it with normal (yellow) potassium
chromate.</p>

<p><i>Lead acetate</i>, Pb(C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">2</span>¬∑3H<span class="su">2</span>O (called &ldquo;sugar&rdquo; of lead, on
account of its sweetish taste), is manufactured by dissolving massicot
in aqueous acetic acid. It forms colourless transparent crystals,
soluble in one and a half parts of cold water and in eight parts of
alcohol, which on exposure to ordinary air become opaque through
absorption of carbonic acid, which forms a crust of basic carbonate.
An aqueous solution readily dissolves lead oxide, with formation
of a strongly alkaline solution containing basic acetates (<i>Acetum
Plumbi</i> or <i>Saturni</i>). When carbon dioxide is passed into this solution
the whole of the added oxide, and even part of the oxide of the
normal salt, is precipitated as a basic carbonate chemically similar,
but not quite equivalent as a pigment, to white lead.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Analysis.</i>&mdash;When mixed with sodium carbonate and heated
on charcoal in the reducing flame lead salts yield malleable
globules of metal and a yellow oxide-ring. Solutions of lead
salts (colourless in the absence of coloured acids) are characterized
by their behaviour to hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid and
potassium chromate. But the most delicate precipitant for lead
is sulphuretted hydrogen, which produces a black precipitate
of lead sulphide, insoluble in cold dilute nitric acid, less so in
cold hydrochloric, and easily decomposed by hot hydrochloric
acid with formation of the characteristic chloride. The atomic
weight, determined by G. P. Baxter and J. H. Wilson (<i>J. Amer.
Chem. Soc.</i>, 1908, 30, p. 187) by analysing the chloride, is 270.190
(O = 16).</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Pharmacology and Therapeutics.</i></p>

<p>The metal itself is not used in medicine. The chief pharmacopoeial
salts are: (1) <i>Plumbi oxidum</i> (lead oxide), litharge.
It is not used internally, but from it is made <i>Emplastrum Plumbi</i>
(diachylon plaster), which is an oleate of lead and is contained in
emplastrum hydrargeri, emplastrum plumbi iodidi, emplastrum
resinae, emplastrum saponis. (2) <i>Plumbi Acetas</i> (sugar of lead),
dose 1 to 5 grains. From this salt are made the following preparations:
(<i>a</i>) <i>Pilula Plumbi cum Opio</i>, the strength of the opium
in it being 1 in 8, dose 2 to 4 grains; (<i>b</i>) <i>Suppositoria Plumbi
composita</i>, containing lead acetate, opium and oil of theobroma,
there being one grain of opium in each suppository; (<i>c</i>) <i>Unguentum
Plumbi Acetatis</i>; (<i>d</i>) <i>Liquor Plumbi Subacetatis Fortior</i>,
Goulard&rsquo;s extract, strength 24% of the subacetate; this again
has a sub-preparation, the <i>Liquor Plumbi Subacetatis Dilutis</i>,
called Goulard&rsquo;s water or Goulard&rsquo;s lotion, containing 1 part in
80 of the strong extract; (<i>e</i>) <i>Glycerinum Plumbi Subacetatis</i>, from
which is made the <i>Unguentum Glycerini Plumbi Subacetatis</i>.
(3) <i>Plumbi Carbonas</i>, white lead, a mixture of the carbonate
and the hydrate, a heavy white powder insoluble in water;
it is not used internally, but from it is made <i>Unguentum Plumbi
Carbonatis</i>, strength 1 in 10 parts of paraffin ointment. (4)
<i>Plumbi Iodidium</i>, a heavy bright yellow powder not used internally.
From it are made (<i>a</i>) <i>Emplastrum Plumbi Iodidi</i>,
and (<i>b</i>) <i>Unguentum Plumbi Iodidi</i>. The strength of each is
1 in 10.</p>

<p>Applied externally lead salts have practically no action upon
the unbroken skin, but applied to sores, ulcers or any exposed
mucous membranes they coagulate the albumen in the tissues
themselves and contract the small vessels. They are very
astringent, haemostatic and sedative; the strong solution of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>320</span>
subacetate is powerfully caustic and is rarely used undiluted.
Lead salts are applied as lotions in conditions where a sedative
astringent effect is desired, as in weeping eczema; in many
varieties of chronic ulceration; and as an injection for various
inflammatory discharges from the vagina, ear and urethra, the
Liquor Plumbi Subacetatis Dilutum being the one employed.
The sedative effect of lead lotion in pruritus is well known.
Internally lead has an astringent action on the mucous membranes,
causing a sensation of dryness; the dilute solution
of the subacetate forms an effective gargle in tonsillitis. The
chief use of the preparations of lead, however, is as an astringent
in acute diarrhoea, particularly if ulceration be present, when
it is usefully given in combination with opium in the form of
the Pilula Plumbi cum Opio. It is useful in haemorrhage from
a gastric ulcer or in haemorrhage from the intestine. Lead salts
usually produce constipation, and lead is an active ecbolic.
Lead is said to enter the blood as an albuminate in which form
it is deposited in the tissues. As a rule the soluble salts if taken
in sufficient quantities produce acute poisoning, and the insoluble
salts chronic plumbism. The symptoms of acute poisoning
are pain and diarrhoea, owing to the setting up of an active
gastro-enteritis, the foeces being black (due to the formation
of a sulphide of lead), thirst, cramps in the legs and muscular
twitchings, with torpor, collapse, convulsions and coma. The
treatment is the prompt use of emetics, or the stomach should
be washed out, and large doses of sodium or magnesium sulphate
given in order to form an insoluble sulphate. Stimulants,
warmth and opium may be required. For an account of chronic
plumbism see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lead Poisoning</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEADHILLITE,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> a rare mineral consisting of basic lead sulphato-carbonate,
Pb<span class="su">4</span>SO<span class="su">4</span>(CO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>(OH)<span class="su">2</span>. Crystals have usually the form
of six-sided plates (fig. 1) or sometimes of acute
rhombohedra (fig. 2); they have a perfect basal
cleavage (parallel to P in fig. 1) on which the
lustre is strongly pearly; they are usually white
and translucent. The hardness is 2.5 and the
sp. gr. 6.26-6.44. The crystallographic and optical
characters point to the existence of three distinct
kinds of leadhillite, which are, however,
identical in external appearance

occur intergrown together
in the same crystal:
(<i>a</i>) monoclinic

second has long been known under the name susannite. The
fact that the published analyses of leadhillite vary somewhat
from the formula given above suggests that these three kinds
may also be chemically distinct.</p>

cerussite, anglesite, &amp;c., in the oxidized portions of lead-bearing
lodes; it has also been found in weathered lead slags left by the
Romans. It has been found most abundantly in the Susanna

W.S.W. of Elvanfoot station on the Caledonian Railway Company&rsquo;s
main line from Glasgow to the south. Pop. (1901) 835.
It is the highest village in Scotland, lying 1301 ft. above sea-level,
near the source of Glengonner Water, an affluent of the Clyde.
It is served by a light railway. Lead and silver have been
mined here and at Wanlockhead, 1¬Ω m. S.W., for many centuries&mdash;according
to some authorities even in Roman days. Gold was
discovered in the reign of James IV., but though it is said then
to have provided employment for 300 persons, its mining has long
ceased to be profitable. The village is neat and well built, and
contains a masonic hall and library, the latter founded by the
miners about the middle of the 18th century. Allan Ramsay,
the poet, and William Symington (1763-1831), one of the earliest
adaptors of the steam engine to the purposes of navigation, were

<p><span class="bold">LEAD POISONING,<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Plumbism</span>, a &ldquo;disease of occupations,&rdquo;
which is itself the cause of organic disease, particularly of the
nervous and urinary systems. The workpeople affected are
principally those engaged in potteries where lead-glaze is used;
but other industries in which health is similarly affected are file-making,
house-painting and glazing, glass-making, copper-working,
coach-making, plumbing and gasfitting, printing, cutlery,
and generally those occupations in which lead is concerned.</p>

<p>The symptoms of chronic lead poisoning vary within very
wide limits, from colic and constipation up to total blindness,
paralysis, convulsions and death. They are thus described by
Dr J. T. Arlidge (<i>Diseases of Occupations</i>):&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The poison finds its way gradually into the whole mass of the
circulating blood, and exerts its effects mainly on the nervous
system, paralysing nerve-force and with it muscular power. Its
victims become of a sallow-waxy hue; the functions of the stomach
and bowels are deranged, appetite fails and painful colic with
constipation supervenes. The loss of power is generally shown
first in the fingers, hands and wrists, and the condition known as
&ldquo;wrist-drop&rdquo; soon follows, rendering the victim useless for work.
The palsy will extend to the shoulders, and after no long time to
the legs also. Other organs frequently involved are the kidneys,
the tissue of which becomes permanently damaged; whilst the
sight is weakened or even lost.</p>
</div>

<p>Dr M&lsquo;Aldowie, senior physician to the North Staffordshire
Infirmary, has stated that &ldquo;in the pottery trade lead is very
slow in producing serious effects compared with certain other
industries.&rdquo; In his experience the average period of working in
lead before serious lesions manifest themselves is 18 years for
females and 22¬Ω years for males. But some individuals fall victims
to the worst forms of plumbism after a few months&rsquo; or even weeks&rsquo;
exposure to the danger. Young persons are more readily affected
than those of mature age, and women more than men. In
addition, there seems to be an element of personal susceptibility,
the nature of which is not understood. Some persons &ldquo;work in
the lead&rdquo; for twenty, forty or fifty years without the slightest
ill effects; others have attacks whenever they are brought into
contact with it. Possibly the difference is due to the general state
of health; robust persons resist the poison successfully, those
with impoverished blood and feeble constitution are mastered
by it. Lead enters the body chiefly through the nose and mouth,
being inspired in the form of dust or swallowed with food eaten
with unwashed hands. It is very apt to get under the nails,
and is possibly absorbed in this way through the skin. Personal
care and cleanliness are therefore of the greatest importance.
A factory surgeon of great experience in the English Potteries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>321</span>
has stated that seventeen out of twenty cases of lead-poisoning
in the china and earthenware industry are due to carelessness
(<i>The Times</i>, 8th October 1898).</p>

<p>The Home Office in England has from time to time made
special rules for workshops and workpeople, with the object of
minimizing or preventing the occurrence of lead-poisoning;
and in 1895 notification of cases was made compulsory. The
health of workpeople in the Potteries was the subject of a special
inquiry by a scientific committee in 1893. The committee
stated that &ldquo;the general truth that the potteries occupation
is one fraught with injury to health and life is beyond dispute,&rdquo;
and that &ldquo;the ill effects of the trade are referable to two chief
causes&mdash;namely, dust and the poison of lead.&rdquo; Of these the
inhalation of clay and flint dust was the more important. It
led to bronchitis, pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia, which
were the most prevalent disorders among potters, and responsible
for 70% of the mortality. That from lead the committee did
not attempt to estimate, but they found that plumbism was less
prevalent than in past times, and expressed the opinion &ldquo;that
a large part of the mortality from lead poisoning is avoidable;
although it must always be borne in mind that no arrangements
or rules, with regard to the work itself, can entirely obviate
the effects of the poison to which workers are exposed, because
so much depends upon the individual and the observance of
personal care and cleanliness.&rdquo; They recommended the adoption
of certain special rules in the workshops, with the objects of
protecting young persons from the lead, of minimizing the evils
of dust, and of promoting cleanliness, particularly in regard to
meals. Some of these recommendations were adopted and applied
with good results. With regard to the suggestion that &ldquo;only
leadless glazes should be used on earthenware,&rdquo; they did not
&ldquo;see any immediate prospect of such glazes becoming universally
applicable to pottery manufacture,&rdquo; and therefore turned their
attention to the question of &ldquo;fritting&rdquo; the lead.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It may be explained that lead is used in china and earthenware to
give the external glaze which renders the naturally porous ware
watertight. Both &ldquo;white&rdquo; and &ldquo;red&rdquo; lead are used. The lead is
added to other ingredients, which have been &ldquo;fritted&rdquo; or fused
together and then ground very fine in water, making a thick creamy
liquid into which the articles are dipped. After dipping the glaze
dries quickly, and on being &ldquo;fired&rdquo; in the kiln it becomes fused by
the heat into the familiar glassy surface. In the manufacture of
ware with enamelled colours, glaze is mixed with the pigment to
form a flux, and such colours are used either moist or in the form of
a dry powder. &ldquo;Fritting&rdquo; the lead means mixing it with the other
ingredients of the glaze beforehand and fusing them all together under
great heat into a kind of rough glass, which is then ground to make
the glaze. Treated in this way the lead combines with the other
ingredients and becomes less soluble, and therefore less dangerous,
than when added afterwards in the raw state. The committee (1893)
thought it &ldquo;reasonable to suppose that the fritting of lead might
ultimately be found universally practicable,&rdquo; but declared that
though fritting &ldquo;no doubt diminishes the danger of lead-poisoning,&rdquo;
they &ldquo;could not regard all fritts as equally innocuous.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In the annual report of the chief inspector of factories for
1897, it was stated that there had been &ldquo;material improvement
in dust conditions&rdquo; in the potting industry, but &ldquo;of lead-poisoning
unfortunately the same could not be said, the number
of grave cases reported, and particularly cases of blindness,
having ominously increased of late.&rdquo; This appears to have been
largely due to the erroneous inclusion among potting processes
of &ldquo;litho-transfer making,&rdquo; a colour industry in which girls are
employed. New special rules were imposed in 1899 prohibiting
the employment of persons under fifteen in the dangerous
processes, ordering a monthly examination of all women and
young persons working in lead by the certifying surgeon, with
power to suspend those showing symptoms of poisoning, and
providing for the more effectual removal of dust and the better
enforcement of cleanliness. At the same time a scientific inquiry
was ordered into the practicability of dispensing with lead in
glazes or of substituting fritted compounds for the raw carbonate.
The scientific experts reported in 1899, recommending that the
use of raw lead should be absolutely prohibited, and expressing
the opinion that the greater amount of earthenware could be
successfully glazed without any lead. These views were in
advance of the opinions held by practical potters, and met with
a good deal of opposition. By certain manufacturers considerable
progress had been made in diminishing the use of raw lead
and towards the discovery of satisfactory leadless glazes; but
it is a long step from individual experiments to the wholesale
compulsory revolution of the processes of manufacture in so
large and varied an industry, and in the face of foreign competitors
hampered by no such regulations. The materials used
by each manufacturer have been arrived at by a long process
of experience, and they are such as to suit the particular goods
he supplies for his particular market. It is therefore difficult
to apply a uniform rule without jeopardizing the prosperity
of the industry, which supports a population of 250,000 in
the Potteries alone. However, the bulk of the manufacturers
agreed to give up the use of raw lead, and to fritt all their glazes
in future, time being allowed to effect the change of process;
but they declined to be bound to any particular composition of
glaze for the reasons indicated.</p>

<p>In 1901 the Home Office brought forward a new set of special
rules. Most of these were framed to strengthen the provisions
for securing cleanliness, removing dust, &amp;c., and were accepted
with a few modifications. But the question of making even
more stringent regulations, even to the extent of making the
use of lead-glaze illegal altogether, was still agitated; and in
1906 the Home Office again appointed an expert committee to
reinvestigate the subject. They reported in 1910, and made
various recommendations in detail for strengthening the
existing regulations; but while encouraging the use of leadless
glaze in certain sorts of common ceramic ware, they pointed
out that, without the use of lead, certain other sorts could
either not be made at all or only at a cost or sacrifice
of quality which would entail the loss of important markets.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1908 Dr Collis made an inquiry into the increase of plumbism
in connexion with the smelting of metals, and he considered the
increase in the cases of poisoning reported to be due to the third
schedule of the Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Act, (1) by causing the
prevalence of pre-existing plumbism to come to light, (2) by the
tendency this fostered to replace men suspected of lead impregnation
by new hands amongst whom the incidence is necessarily greater.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEADVILLE,<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> a city and the county seat of Lake county,
Colorado, U.S.A., one of the highest (mean elevation <i>c.</i> 10,150
ft.) and most celebrated mining &ldquo;camps&rdquo; of the world. Pop.
(1900) 12,455, of whom 3802 were foreign-born; (1910 census)
7508. It is served by the Denver &amp; Rio Grande, the Colorado
&amp; Southern and the Colorado Midland railways. It lies amid
towering mountains on a terrace of the western flank of the
Mosquito Range at the head of the valley of the Arkansas river,
where the river cuts the valley between the Mosquito and the
Sawatch (Saguache) ranges. Among the peaks in the immediate
environs are Mt. Massive (14,424 ft., the highest in the state)
and Elbert Peak (14,421 ft.). There is a United States fish
hatchery at the foot of Mt. Massive. In the spring of 1860
placer gold was discovered in California Gulch, and by July
1860 Oro City had probably 10,000 inhabitants. In five years
the total yield was more than $5,000,000; then it diminished,
and Oro City shrank to a few hundred inhabitants. This settlement
was within the present limits of Leadville. In 1876 the
output of the mines was about $20,000. During sixteen years
&ldquo;heavy sands&rdquo; and great boulders that obstructed the placer
fields had been moved thoughtlessly to one side. These boulders
were from enormous lead carbonate deposits extremely rich in
silver. The discovery of these deposits was made on the hills
at the edge of Leadville. The first building was erected in June
1877; in December there were several hundred miners, in
January the town was organized and named; at the end of 1879
there were, it is said, 35,000 inhabitants. Leadville was already
a chartered city, with the usual organization and all public
facilities. In 1880 it was reached by the Denver &amp; Rio Grande
railway. In early years Leadville was one of the most turbulent,
picturesque and in all ways extraordinary, of the mining camps
of the West. The value of the output from 1879 to 1889 totalled
$147,834,186, including one-fifth of the silver production and a
third of the lead consumption of the country. The decline in
the price of silver, culminating with the closing of the India mints
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span>
and the repeal of the Sherman Law in 1893, threatened Leadville&rsquo;s
future. But the source of the gold of the old placers was
found in 1892. From that year to 1899 the gold product rose
from $262,692 to $2,183,332. From 1879 to 1900 the camp
yielded $250,000,000 (as compared with $48,000,000 of gold
and silver in five years from the Comstock, Nevada, lode; and
$60,000,000 and 225,000 tons of lead, in fourteen years, from
the Eureka, Nevada, mines). Before 1898 the production of zinc
was unimportant, but in 1906 it was more valuable than that of
silver and gold combined. This increased output is a result of
the establishment of concentrating mills, in which the zinc
content is raised from 18 or 20% in the raw ores to 25 or 45%
in the concentrates. In 1904, per ton of Lake county ore, zinc
was valued at $6.93, silver at $4.16, lead at $3.85, gold at $1.77
and copper at $.66. The copper mined at Leadville amounted
to about one-third the total mined in the state in 1906. Iron
and manganese have been produced here, and in 1906 Leadville
was the only place in the United States known to have produced
bismuth. There were two famous labour strikes in the
&ldquo;diggings&rdquo; in 1879 and 1896. The latter attracted national
attention; it lasted from the 19th of June 1896 to the 9th of
March 1897, when the miners, being practically starved out,
declared the strike off. There had been a riot on the 21st of
September 1896 and militia guarded the mines for months
afterwards. In January 1897 the mines on Carbonate Hill
were flooded after the removal of their pumps. This strike
closed many mines, which were not opened for several years.
Leadville stocks are never on the exchange, and &ldquo;flotation&rdquo;
and &ldquo;promotion&rdquo; have been almost unknown.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The ores of the Leadville District occur in a blue limestone formation
overlaid by porphyry, and are in the form of heavy sulphides,
containing copper, gold, silver, lead and zinc; oxides containing
iron, manganese and small amounts of silver and lead; and siliceous
ores, containing much silver and a little lead and gold. The best
grade of ores usually consists of a mixture of sulphides, with some
native gold. Nowhere have more wonderful advances in mining
been apparent&mdash;in the size and character of furnaces and pumps;
the development of local smelter supplies; the fall in the cost of
coal, of explosives and other mine supplies; the development of
railways and diminution of freight expenses; and the general improvement
of economic and scientific methods&mdash;than at Leadville
since 1880. The increase of output more than doubled from 1890 to
1900, and many ores once far too low in grade for working now yield
sure profits. The Leadville smelters in 1900 had a capacity of
35,000 tons monthly; about as much more local ore being treated at
Denver, Pueblo and other places.</p>

<p>Leaves are produced as lateral outgrowths of the stem in
definite succession below the apex. This character, common
to all leaves, distinguishes them from other organs. In the
higher plants we can easily recognize the distinction between
stem and leaf. Amongst the lower plants, however, it is found
that a demarcation into stem and leaf is impossible, but that
there is a structure which partakes of the characters of both&mdash;such
is a <i>thallus</i>. The leaves always arise from the outer portion
of the primary meristem of the plant, and the tissues of the leaf
are continuous with those of the stem. Every leaf originates as
a simple cellular papilla (fig. 1), which consists of a development
from the cortical layers covered by epidermis; and as growth
proceeds, the fibro-vascular bundles of the stem are continued
outwards, and finally expand and terminate in the leaf. The
increase in length of the leaf by growth at the apex is usually
of a limited nature. In some ferns, however, there seems to be
a provision for indefinite terminal growth, while in others this
growth is periodically interrupted.
It not unfrequently
happens, especially
amongst Monocotyledons,
that after growth at the
apex has ceased, it is continued
at the base of the
leaf, and in this way the
length may be much increased.
Amongst Dicotyledons
this is very rare.
In all cases the dimensions
of the leaf are enlarged by
interstitial growth of its
parts.</p>

<p>The simplest leaf is found
in some mosses, where it
consists of a
single layer of
cells. The typical
<span class="sidenote">Structure of leaves.</span>
foliage leaf consists of
several layers, and amongst
vascular plants is distinguishable
into an outer layer (<i>epidermis</i>) and a central
tissue (<i>parenchyma</i>) with fibro-vascular bundles distributed
through it.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>epidermis</i> (fig. 2, <i>es</i>, <i>ei</i>), composed of cells more or less compressed,
has usually a different structure and aspect on the two
surfaces of the leaf. The cells of the epidermis are very closely
united laterally and contain no green colouring matter (chlorophyll)
except in the pair of cells&mdash;guard-cells&mdash;which bound the stomata.
The outer wall, especially of the upper epidermis, has a tough outer
layer or cuticle which
renders it impervious to
water. The epidermis
is continuous except
where stomata or spaces
bounded by specialized
cells communicate with
intercellular spaces in
the interior of the leaf.
It is chiefly on the epidermis
of the lower surface
(fig. 2, <i>ei</i>) that
stomata, <i>st</i>, are produced,
and it is there
also that hairs, <i>p</i>, usually
occur. The lower epidermis
is often of a dull
or pale-green colour, soft
and easily detached.
The upper epidermis is
frequently smooth and
shining, and sometimes
becomes very hard and
dense. Many tropical
plants present on the
upper surface of their
leaves several layers of
compressed cells beneath
the epidermis which
serve for storage of water
and are known as
aqueous tissue. In
leaves which float upon
the surface of the water,
as those of the water-lily, the upper epidermis alone possesses
stomata.</p>

<p>The <i>parenchyma</i> of the leaf is the cellular tissue enclosed within
the epidermis and surrounding the vessels (fig. 2, <i>ps</i>, <i>pi</i>). It is known
as <i>mesophyll</i>, and is formed of two distinct series of cells, each containing
the green chlorophyll-granules, but differing in form and
arrangement. Below the epidermis of the upper side of the leaf
there are one or two layers of cells, elongated at right angles to the
leaf surface (fig. 2, <i>ps</i>), and applied so closely to each other as to leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span>
only small intercellular spaces, except where stomata happen to
be present (fig. 2, <i>m</i>); they form the palisade tissue. On the other
side of the leaf the cells are irregular, often branched, and are
arranged more or less horizontally (fig. 2, <i>pi</i>), leaving air-spaces
between them, <i>l</i>, which communicate with stomata; on this account
the tissue has received the name of spongy. In leaves having a
very firm texture, as those of Coniferae and Cycadaceae, the cells of
the parenchyma immediately beneath the epidermis are very much
thickened and elongated in a direction parallel to the surface of the
leaf, so as to be fibre-like. These constitute a hypodermal layer,
beneath which the chlorophyll cells of the parenchyma are densely
packed together, and are elongated in a direction vertical to the
surface of the leaf, forming the palisade tissue. The form and
arrangement of the cells, however, depend much on the nature of
the plant, and its exposure to light and air. Sometimes the arrangement
of the cells on both sides of the leaf is similar, as occurs in
leaves which have their edges presented to the sky. In very succulent
plants the cells form a compact mass, and those in the centre
are often colourless. In some cases the cellular tissue is deficient
at certain points, giving rise to distinct holes in the leaf, as in <i>Monstera
Adansonii</i>. The fibro-vascular system in the leaf constitutes
the <i>venation</i>. The fibro-vascular bundles from the stem bend out
into the leaf, and are there arranged in a definite manner. In
<i>skeleton leaves</i>, or leaves in which the parenchyma is removed,
this arrangement is well seen. In some leaves, as in the barberry,
the veins are hardened, producing spines without any parenchyma.
The hardening of the extremities of the fibro-vascular tissue is the
cause of the spiny margin of many leaves, such as the holly, of the
sharp-pointed leaves of madder, and of mucronate leaves, or those
having a blunt end with a hard projection in the centre.</p>
</div>

<p>The form and arrangement of the parts of a typical foliage
leaf are intimately associated with the part played by the leaf
in the life of the plant. The flat surface is spread to allow the
maximum amount of sunlight to fall upon it, as it is by the
absorption of energy from the sun&rsquo;s rays by means of the chlorophyll
contained in the cells of the leaf that the building up
of plant food is rendered possible; this process is known as
photo-synthesis; the first stage is the combination of carbon
dioxide, absorbed from the air taken in through the
stomata into the living cells of the leaf, with water which
is brought into the leaf by the wood-vessels. The wood-vessels
form part of the fibro-vascular bundles or veins of the leaf
and are continuous throughout the leaf-stalk and stem with
the root by which water is absorbed from the soil. The
palisade layers of the mesophyll contain the larger number of
chlorophyll grains (or corpuscles) while the absorption of
carbon dioxide is carried on chiefly through the lower
epidermis which is generally much richer in stomata. The
water taken up by the root from the soil contains nitrogenous
and mineral salts which combine with the first product
of photo-synthesis&mdash;a carbohydrate&mdash;to form more
complicated nitrogen-containing food substances of a proteid
nature; these are then distributed by other elements of the
vascular bundles (the <i>phloem</i>) through the leaf to the stem and
so throughout the plant to wherever growth or development is
going on. A large proportion of the water which ascends to
the leaf acts merely as a carrier for the other raw food materials
and is got rid of from the leaf in the form of water vapour through
the stomata&mdash;this process is known as <i>transpiration</i>. Hence the
extended surface of the leaf exposing a large area to light and
air is eminently adapted for the carrying out of the process of
photo-synthesis and transpiration. The arrangement of the
leaves on the stem and branches (see <i>Phyllotaxy</i>, below) is such
as to prevent the upper leaves shading the lower, and the shape
of the leaf serves towards the same end&mdash;the disposition of
leaves on a branch or stem is often seen to form a &ldquo;mosaic,&rdquo;
each leaf fitting into the space between neighbouring leaves and
the branch on which they are borne without overlapping.</p>

<p>Submerged leaves, or leaves which are developed under water,
differ in structure from aerial leaves. They have usually no
fibro-vascular system, but consist of a congeries of cells, which
sometimes become elongated and compressed so as to resemble
veins. They have a layer of compact cells on their surface, but
no true epidermis, and no stomata. Their internal structure
consists of cells, disposed irregularly, and sometimes leaving
spaces which are filled with air for the purpose of floating the
leaf. When exposed to the air these leaves easily part with their
moisture, and become shrivelled and dry. In some cases there
is only a network of filament-like cells, the spaces between
which are not filled with parenchyma, giving a skeleton appearance
to the leaf, as in <i>Ouvirandra fenestralis</i> (Lattice plant).</p>

<p>A leaf, whether aerial or submerged, generally consists of a
flat expanded portion, called the <i>blade</i>, or <i>lamina</i>, of a narrower
portion called the <i>petiole</i> or <i>stalk</i>, and sometimes of a portion
at the base of the petiole, which forms a <i>sheath</i> or <i>vagina</i>
(fig. 5, <i>s</i>), or is developed in the form of outgrowths, called
<i>stipules</i> (fig. 24, <i>s</i>). All these portions are not always present.
The sheathing or stipulary portion is frequently wanting.
When a leaf has a distinct stalk it is <i>petiolate</i>; when it has none,
it is <i>sessile</i>, and if in this case it embraces the stem it is said to be
<i>amplexicaul</i>. The part of the leaf next the petiole or the axis
is the <i>base</i>, while the opposite extremity is the <i>apex</i>. The leaf
is usually flattened and expanded horizontally, <i>i.e.</i> at right angles
to the longitudinal axis of the shoot, so that the upper face is
directed towards the heavens, and the lower towards the earth.
In some cases leaves, as in Iris, or leaf-like petioles, as in Australian
acacias and eucalypti, have their plane of expansion parallel
to the axis of the shoot, there is then no distinction into an upper
and a lower face, but the two sides are developed alike; or the
leaf may have a cylindrical or polyhedral form, as in mesembryanthemum.
The upper angle formed between the leaf and the
stem is called its <i>axil</i>; it is there that leaf-buds are normally
developed. The leaf is sometimes articulated with the stem,
and when it falls off a <i>scar</i> remains; at other times it is continuous
with it, and then decays, while still attached to the axis.
In their early state all leaves are continuous with the stem, and
it is only in their after growth that articulations are formed.
When leaves fall off annually they are called <i>deciduous</i>; when
they remain for two or more years they are <i>persistent</i>, and the
plant is <i>evergreen</i>. The laminar portion of a leaf is occasionally
articulated with the petiole, as in the orange, and a joint at times
exists between the vaginal or stipulary portion and the petiole.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt2">The arrangement of the fibro-vascular system in the lamina
constitutes the <i>venation</i> or <i>nervation</i>. In an ordinary leaf, as that
of the elm, there is observed a large central vein running
from the base to the apex of the leaf, this is the <i>midrib</i>
<span class="sidenote">Venation.</span>
(fig. 3); it gives off veins laterally (<i>primary veins</i>). A leaf with
only a single midrib is said to be <i>unicostate</i> and the venation is
described as pinnate or feather-veined. In some cases, as sycamore
or castor oil (fig. 4), in place of there being only a single midrib there
are several large veins (<i>ribs</i>) of nearly equal size, which diverge from
the point where the blade joins the petiole or stem, giving off lateral
veins. The leaf in this case is <i>multicostate</i> and the venation palmate.
The primary veins give off secondary veins, and these in their turn
give off tertiary veins, and so on until a complete network of vessels
is produced, and those veins usually project on the under surface of
the leaf. To a distribution of veins such as this the name of <i>reticulated</i>
or <i>netted</i> venation has been applied. In the leaves of some plants
there exists a midrib with large veins running nearly parallel to it
from the base to the apex of the lamina, as in grasses (fig. 5); or
with veins diverging from the base of the lamina in more or less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>324</span>
parallel lines, as in fan palms (fig. 6), or with veins coming off
from it throughout its whole course, and running parallel to each
other in a straight or curved direction towards the margin of the leaf,
as in plantain and banana. In these cases the veins are often united
by cross veinlets, which do not, however, form an angular network.
Such leaves are said to be <i>parallel-veined</i>. The leaves of Monocotyledons
have generally this kind of venation, while reticulated
venation most usually occurs amongst Dicotyledons. Some plants,
which in most points of their structure
are monocotyledonous, yet have
reticulated venation; as in <i>Smilax</i>
and <i>Dioscorea</i>. In vascular acotyledonous
plants there is frequently a
tendency to fork exhibited by the
fibro-vascular bundles in the leaf;
and when this is the case we have
<i>fork-veined</i> leaves. This is well seen
in many ferns. The distribution of
the system of vessels in the leaf is
usually easily traced, but in the case of succulent plants, as <i>Hoya</i>,
agave, stonecrop and mesembryanthemum, the veins are obscure.
The function of the veins which consist of vessels and fibres is to
form a rigid framework for the leaf and to conduct liquids.</p>

<p class="pt2">In all plants, except Thallophytes, leaves are present at some
period of their existence. In <i>Cuscuta</i> (Dodder) (<i>q.v.</i>), however,
we have an exception. The forms assumed by leaves vary much,
not only in different plants, but in the same plant. It is only
amongst the lower classes of plants&mdash;Mosses, Characeae, &amp;c.&mdash;that
all the leaves on a plant are similar. As we pass up the
scale of plant life we find them becoming more and more variable.
The structures in ordinary language designated as leaves are
considered so <i>par excellence</i>, and they are frequently spoken of
as <i>foliage leaves</i>. In relation to their production on the stem we
may observe that when they are small they are always produced
in great number, and as they increase in size their number
diminishes correspondingly. The cellular process from the
axis which develops into a leaf is simple and undivided; it
rarely remains so, but in progress of growth becomes segmented
in various ways, either longitudinally or laterally, or in both
ways. By longitudinal segmentation we have a leaf formed
consisting of sheath, stalk and blade; or one or other of these
may be absent, and thus stalked, sessile, sheathing, &amp;c., leaves
are produced. Lateral segmentation affects the lamina, producing
indentations, lobings or fissuring of its margins. In
this way two marked forms of leaf are produced&mdash;(1) <i>Simple</i>
form, in which the segmentation, however deeply it extends into
the lamina, does not separate portions of the lamina which
become articulated with the midrib or petiole; and (2) <i>Compound</i>
form, where portions of the lamina are separated as
detached <i>leaflets</i>, which become articulated with the midrib or
petiole. In both simple and compound leaves, according to the
amount of segmentation and the mode of development of the
parenchyma and direction of the fibro-vascular bundles, many
forms are produced.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Simple Leaves.</i>&mdash;When the parenchyma is developed symmetrically
on each side of the midrib or stalk, the leaf is <i>equal</i>; if otherwise,
the leaf is <i>unequal</i> or <i>oblique</i> (fig. 3). If the margins are
even and present no divisions, the leaf is <i>entire</i> (fig. 7);
<span class="sidenote">Simple leaves.</span>
if there are slight projections which are more or less
pointed, the leaf is <i>dentate</i> or toothed; when the projections lie
regularly over each other, like the teeth of a saw, the leaf is <i>serrate</i>
(fig. 3); when they are rounded the leaf is <i>crenate</i>. If the divisions
extend more deeply into the lamina than the margin, the leaf receives
different names according to the nature of the segments; thus, when
the divisions extend about half-way down (fig. 8), it is <i>cleft</i>; when the
divisions extend nearly to the base or to the midrib the leaf is <i>partite</i>.</p>

<p>If these divisions take place in a simple <i>feather-veined</i> leaf it becomes
either <i>pinnatifid</i> (fig. 9), when the segments extend to about the
middle, or <i>pinnatipartite</i>, when the divisions extend nearly to the
midrib. These primary divisions may be again subdivided in a
similar manner, and thus a feather-veined leaf will become <i>bipinnatifid</i>
or <i>bipinnatipartite</i>; still further subdivisions give origin
to <i>tripinnatifid</i> and <i>laciniated</i> leaves. The same kinds of divisions
taking place in a simple leaf with palmate or <i>radiating</i> venation, give
origin to <i>lobed</i>, <i>cleft</i> and <i>partite</i> forms. The name <i>palmate</i> or <i>palmatifid</i>
(fig. 4) is the general term applied to leaves with radiating venation,
in which there are several lobes united by a broad expansion of
parenchyma, like the palm of the hand, as in the sycamore, castor-oil
plant, &amp;c. The divisions of leaves with radiating venation may
extend to near the base of the leaf, and the names <i>bipartite</i>, <i>tripartite</i>,
<i>quinquepartite</i>, &amp;c., are given according as the partitions are two,
three, five or more. The term <i>dissected</i> is applied to leaves with
radiating venation, having
numerous narrow divisions, as
in <i>Geranium dissectum</i>.</p>

<p class="pt2">When in a radiating leaf there
are three primary partitions,
and the two lateral lobes are
again cleft, as in hellebore (fig.
11), the leaf is called <i>pedate</i> or
<i>pedatifid</i>, from a fancied resemblance
to the claw of a bird. In all the instances already alluded
to the leaves have been considered as flat expansions, in which the
ribs or veins spread out on the same plane with the stalk. In some
cases, however, the veins spread at right angles to the stalk, forming
a <i>peltate</i> leaf as in Indian cress (fig. 12).</p>

<p>The form of the leaf shows a very great variety ranging from the
narrow <i>linear</i> form with parallel sides, as in grasses or the needle-like
leaves of pines and firs to more or less rounded or <i>orbicular</i>&mdash;descriptions
of these will be found in works on descriptive botany&mdash;a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span>
examples are illustrated here (figs. 7, 13, 14, 15). The apex also
varies considerably, being rounded, or <i>obtuse</i>, sharp or <i>acute</i> (fig. 7),
notched (fig. 15), &amp;c. Similarly the shape of the base may vary,
when rounded lobes are formed, as in dog-violet, the leaf is cordate
or heart-shaped; or kidney-shaped or <i>reniform</i> (fig. 16), when the apex
is rounded as in ground ivy. When the lobes are prolonged downwards
and are acute, the leaf is <i>sagittate</i> (fig. 17); when they proceed
at right angles, as in <i>Rumex Acetosella</i>, the leaf is <i>hastate</i> or halbert-shaped.
When a simple leaf is divided at the base into two leaf-like
appendages, it is called <i>auriculate</i>. When the development of
parenchyma is such that it more than fills up the spaces between
the veins, the margins become <i>wavy</i>, <i>crisp</i> or <i>undulated</i>, as in <i>Rumex
crispus</i> and <i>Rheum undulatum</i>. By cultivation the cellular tissue is
often much increased, giving rise to the <i>curled</i> leaves of greens,
savoys, cresses, lettuce, &amp;c.</p>

leaf, because in its earliest state it arises from the axis as a single
piece, and its subsequent divisions in the form of leaflets are all in
one plane. The leaflets are either sessile (fig. 18) or have stalks,
called <i>petiolules</i> (fig. 19). Compound leaves are pinnate (fig. 19) or
palmate (fig. 18) according to the arrangement of leaflets. When
a pinnate leaf ends in a pair of pinnae it is <i>equally</i> or <i>abruptly pinnate</i>
(paripinnate); when there is a single terminal leaflet (fig. 19), the leaf
is <i>unequally pinnate</i> (imparipinnate); when the leaflets or pinnae are
placed alternately on either side of the midrib, and not directly opposite
to each other, the leaf is <i>alternately pinnate</i>; and when the pinnae are
of different sizes, the leaf is <i>interruptedly pinnate</i>. When the division
is carried into the second degree, and the pinnae of a compound

<p class="pt2">The <i>petiole</i> or leaf-stalk is the part which unites the limb or blade
of the leaf to the stem. It is absent in <i>sessile</i> leaves, and this is also
frequently the case when a sheath is present, as in grasses
(fig. 5). It consists of the fibro-vascular bundles with a
<span class="sidenote">Petiole.</span>
varying amount of cellular tissue. When the vascular bundles reach
the base of the lamina they separate and spread out in various ways,
as already described under venation. The lower part of the petiole
is often swollen (fig. 20, <i>p</i>), forming the <i>pulvinus</i>, formed of cellular
tissue, the cells of which exhibit the phenomenon of irritability.
In <i>Mimosa pudica</i> (fig. 20) a sensitiveness is located in the pulvinus
which upon irritation induces a depression of the whole bipinnate
leaf, a similar property exists in the pulvini at the base of the leaflets
which fold upwards. The petiole varies in length, being usually
shorter than the lamina, but sometimes much longer. In some
palms it is 15 or 20 ft. long, and is so firm as to be used for poles or
walking-sticks. In general, the petiole is more or less rounded in its
form, the upper surface being flattened or grooved. Sometimes it is
compressed laterally, as in the aspen, and to this peculiarity the
trembling of the leaves of this tree is due. In aquatic plants the leaf-stalk
is sometimes distended with air, as in <i>Pontederia</i> and <i>Trapa</i>,
so as to float the leaf. At other times it is
<i>winged</i>, and is either leafy, as in the orange
(fig. 21, <i>p</i>), lemon and <i>Dionaea</i>, or pitcher-like,
as in <i>Sarracenia</i> (fig. 22). In some
Australian acacias, and in some species of
<i>Oxalis</i> and <i>Bupleurum</i>, the petiole is flattened
in a vertical direction, the vascular bundles
separating immediately after quitting the
stem and running nearly parallel from base
to apex. This kind of petiole (fig. 23, <i>p</i>)
has been called a <i>phyllode</i>. In these plants
the laminae or blades of the leaves are pinnate
or bipinnate, and are produced at the
extremities of the phyllodes in a horizontal direction; but in
many instances they are not developed, and the phyllode serves
the purpose of a leaf. These phyllodes, by their vertical position
and their peculiar form, give a remarkable aspect to vegetation.
On the same acacia there occur leaves with the petiole and lamina
perfect; others having the petiole slightly expanded or winged, and
the lamina imperfectly developed; and others in which there is no
lamina, and the petiole becomes large and broad. Some petioles
are long, slender and sensitive to contact, and function as tendrils
by means of
which the plant
climbs; as in the
nasturtiums
(<i>Tropaeolum</i>),
clematis and
others; and in
compound leaves
the midrib and
some of the leaflets
may similarly
be transformed
into tendrils, as in
the pea and vetch.</p>

sheath forms a complete investment of the stem, whilst in
grasses it is split on one side. In the latter plants there is
also a membranous outgrowth, the <i>ligule</i>, at right angles to the
median plane of the leaf from the point where the sheath passes
into the lamina, there being no petiole (fig. 5, <i>l</i>).</p>

<p class="pt2">In leaves in which no sheath is produced we not infrequently
find small foliar organs, <i>stipules</i>, at the base of the petiole (fig. 24, <i>s</i>).
The stipules are generally two in number, and they are important as
supplying characters in certain natural orders. Thus they occur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>326</span>
in the pea and bean family, in rosaceous plants and the family
Rubiaceae. They are not common in dicotyledons with opposite
leaves. Plants having stipules are called <i>stipulate</i>; those having
none are <i>exstipulate</i>. Stipules may be large or small, entire or divided,
deciduous or persistent. They are not usually of the same form as the
ordinary foliage leaves of the plant, from which they are distinguished
by their lateral position at the base of the petiole. In the pansy
(fig. 24) the true
leaves are stalked
and crenate, while
the stipules <i>s</i> are
large, sessile and pinnatifid.
In <i>Lathyrus
Aphaca</i> and some
other plants the true
pinnate leaves are
abortive, the petiole
forms a tendril, and
the stipules alone are
developed, performing
the office of
leaves. When stipulate
leaves are opposite
to each other,
at the same height
on the stem, it occasionally
happens
that the stipules on
the two sides unite
wholly or partially,
so as to form an <i>interpetiolary</i>
or <i>interfoliar</i>
stipule, as in
members of the
family Rubiaceae. In the case of alternate leaves, the stipules at
the base of each leaf are sometimes united to the petiole and to each
other, so as to form an <i>adnate</i>, <i>adherent</i> or <i>petiolary</i> stipule, as in the
rose, or an <i>axillary</i> stipule, as in <i>Houttuynia cordata</i>. In other instances
the stipules unite together on the side of the stem opposite
the leaf forming an <i>ocrea</i>, as in the dock family (fig. 25).</p>

<p>In the development of the leaf the stipules frequently play a most
important part. They begin
to be formed after the origin
of the leaves, but grow much
more rapidly than the leaves,
and in this way they arch over
the young leaves and form
protective chambers wherein
the parts of the leaf may develop.
In the figs, magnolia
and pondweeds they are very
large and completely envelop
the young leaf-bud. The stipules
are sometimes so minute
as to be scarcely distinguishable
without the aid of a lens,
and so fugacious as to be
visible only in the very young
state of the leaf. They may
assume a hard and spiny character,
as in <i>Robinia Pseudacacia</i>
(fig. 19), or may be cirrose,
as in <i>Smilax</i>, where each
stipule is represented by a
tendril. At the base of the
leaflets of a compound leaf,
small stipules (<i>stipels</i>) are
occasionally produced.</p>

<p>Variations in the structure
and forms of leaves and leafstalks
are produced
by the increased
development of cellular
tissue, by the abortion or
degeneration of parts, by the
multiplication or repetition of
parts and by adhesion. When
cellular tissue is developed to
a great extent, leaves become
succulent and occasionally
<span class="sidenote">Modifications.</span>
assume a crisp or curled appearance.
Such changes take
place naturally, but they are
often increased by the art of the gardener, and the object of
many horticultural operations is to increase the bulk and succulence
of leaves. It is in this way that cabbages and savoys
are rendered more delicate and nutritious. By a deficiency in
development of parenchyma and an increase in the mechanical
tissue, leaves are liable to become hardened and spinescent.
The leaves of barberry and of some species of <i>Astragalus</i>, and the
stipules of the false acacia (<i>Robinia</i>) are spiny. To the same
cause is due the spiny margin of the holly-leaf. When two lobes
at the base of a leaf are prolonged beyond the stem and unite (fig. 26),
the leaf is <i>perfoliate</i>, the stem appearing to pass through it, as in
<i>Bupleurum perfoliatum</i> and <i>Chlora perfoliata</i>; when two leaves unite
by their bases they become <i>connate</i> (fig. 27), as in <i>Lonicera Caprifolium</i>;
and when leaves adhere to the stem, forming a sort of
winged or leafy appendage,
they are
<i>decurrent</i>, as in
thistles. The formation
of peltate
leaves has been
traced to the union
of the lobes of a cleft
leaf. In the leaf of
the <i>Victoria regia</i> the
transformation may
be traced during
germination. The
first leaves produced
by the young plant
are linear, the second
are sagittate and
hastate, the third
are rounded-cordate
and the next are
orbicular. The cleft
indicating the union
of the lobes remains
in the large leaves.
The parts of the leaf are frequently transformed into <i>tendrils</i>, with the
view of enabling the plants to twine round others for support. In
Leguminous plants (the pea tribe) the pinnae are frequently modified
to form tendrils, as in <i>Lathyrus Aphaca</i>, in which the stipules perform
the function of true leaves. In <i>Flagellaria indica</i>, <i>Gloriosa superba</i>
and others, the midrib of the leaf ends in a tendril. In <i>Smilax</i> there
are two stipulary tendrils.</p>

<p class="pt2">The vascular bundles and cellular tissue are sometimes developed
in such a way as to form a circle, with a hollow in the centre, and thus
give rise to what are called <i>fistular</i> or hollow leaves, as in the onion,
and to <i>ascidia</i> or <i>pitchers</i>. Pitchers are
formed either by petioles or by laminae, and
they are composed of one or more leaves.
In <i>Sarracenia</i> (fig. 22) and <i>Heliamphora</i> the
pitcher is composed of the petiole of the leaf.
In the pitcher plant, <i>Nepenthes</i>, the pitcher
is a modification of the lamina, the petiole
often plays the part of a tendril, while the
leaf base is flat and leaf-like (fig. 28).</p>

produced abundantly upon underground
shoots. In parasites (<i>Lathraea</i>, <i>Orobanche</i>)
and in plants growing on decaying vegetable
matter (<i>saprophytes</i>), in which no chlorophyll
is formed, these scales are the only
leaves produced. In <i>Pinus</i> the only leaves
produced on the main stem and the lateral
shoots are scales, the acicular leaves of the
tree growing from axillary shoots. In <i>Cycas</i>
whorls of scales alternate with large pinnate
leaves. In many plants, as already noticed, phyllodia or stipules
perform the function of leaves. The production of leaf-buds from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>
leaves sometimes occurs as in <i>Bryophyllum</i>, and many plants of the
order Gesneraceae. The leaf of Venus&rsquo;s fly-trap (<i>Dionaea muscipula</i>)
when cut off and placed in damp moss, with a pan of water underneath
and a bell-glass for a cover, has produced buds from which
young plants were obtained. Some species of saxifrage and of
ferns also produce buds on their leaves and fronds. In <i>Nymphaea
micrantha</i> buds appear at the upper part of the petiole.</p>
</div>

<p>Leaves occupy various positions on the stem and branches,
<span class="sidenote">Phyllotaxis.</span>
and have received different names according to their situation.
Thus leaves arising from the crown of the root, as in
the primrose, are called <i>radical</i>; those on the stem are
<i>cauline</i>; on flower-stalks, <i>floral</i> leaves (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Flower</a></span>).
The first leaves developed are known as seed leaves or <i>cotyledons</i>.
The arrangement of the leaves on the axis and its appendages
is called <i>phyllotaxis</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt2">In their arrangement leaves follow a definite order. The points
on the stem at which leaves appear are called nodes; the part
of the stem between the nodes is the <i>internode</i>. When two leaves
are produced at the same node, one on each side of the stem or axis,
and at the same level, they are <i>opposite</i> (fig. 29); when more than
two are produced they are <i>verticillate</i>, and the circle of leaves is then
called a <i>verticil</i> or <i>whorl</i>.
When leaves are opposite,
each successive pair may be
placed at right angles to the
pair immediately preceding.
They are then said to <i>decussate</i>,
following thus a law of
alternation (fig. 29). The
same occurs in the verticillate
arrangement, the leaves of
each whorl rarely being <i>superposed</i>
on those of the whorl
next it, but usually alternating
so that each leaf in a
whorl occupies the space between
two leaves of the whorl
next to it. There are considerable
irregularities, however,
in this respect, and the
number of leaves in different
whorls is not always uniform,
as may be seen in <i>Lysimachia
vulgaris</i>. When a single leaf
is produced at a node, and
the nodes are separated so
that each leaf is placed at a
different height on the stem,
the leaves are <i>alternate</i> (fig.
30). A plane passing through
the point of insertion of the
leaf in the node, dividing
the leaf into similar halves,
is the median plane of the
leaf; and when the leaves are
arranged alternately on an
axis so that their median
planes coincide they form a
straight row or <i>orthostichy</i>.
On every axis there are usually
two or more orthostichies. In
fig. 31, leaf 1 arises from a
node <i>n</i>; leaf 2 is separated from it by an internode m, and is placed
to the right or left; while leaf 3 is situated directly above leaf 1. In
this case, then, there are two orthostichies, and the arrangement is
said to be <i>distichous</i>. When the fourth leaf is directly above the first,
the arrangement is <i>tristichous</i>. The same arrangement continues
throughout the branch, so that in the latter case the 7th leaf is above
the 4th, the 10th above the 7th; also the 5th above the 2nd, the
6th above the 3rd and so on. The size of the angle between the
median planes of two consecutive leaves in an alternate arrangement
is their <i>divergence</i>; and it is expressed in fractions of the circumference
of the axis which is supposed to be a circle. In a regularly-formed
straight branch covered with leaves, if a thread is passed
from one to the other, turning always in the same direction, a spiral
is described, and a certain number of leaves and of complete turns
occur before reaching the leaf directly above that from which the
enumeration commenced. If this arrangement is expressed by a
fraction, the numerator of which indicates the number of turns, and
the denominator the number of internodes in the spiral cycle, the
fraction will be found to represent the angle of divergence of the
consecutive leaves on the axis. Thus, in fig. 32, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, the cycle consists
of five leaves, the 6th leaf being placed vertically over the 1st,
the 7th over the 2nd and so on; while the number of turns between
the 1st and 6th leaf is two; hence this arrangement is indicated by
the fraction <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>. In other words, the distance or divergence between
the first and second leaf, expressed in parts of a circle, is <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> of a circle
or 360¬∞ √ó <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> = 144¬∞. In fig. 31, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, the spiral is ¬Ω, <i>i.e.</i> one turn and
two leaves; the third leaf being placed vertically over the first,
and the divergence between the first and second leaf being one-half
the circumference of a circle, 360¬∞ √ó ¬Ω = 180¬∞. Again, in a tristichous
arrangement the number is <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, or one turn and three leaves, the angular
divergence being 120¬∞.</p>

<p class="pt2">By this means we have a convenient mode of expressing on paper
the exact position of the leaves upon an axis. And in many cases
such a mode of expression is of excellent service in enabling us
readily to understand
the relations of the
leaves. The divergences
may also be represented
diagrammatically on a
horizontal projection of
the vertical axis, as in
fig. 33. Here the outermost
circle represents a
section of that portion
of the axis bearing the
lowest leaf, the innermost
represents the
highest. The broad
dark lines represent the
leaves, and they are
numbered according to
their age and position.
It will be seen at once
that the leaves are arranged
in orthostichies
marked I.-V., and that
these divide the circumference
into five equal
portions. But the
divergence between leaf
1 and leaf 2 is equal to
<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>ths of the circumference,
and the same
is the case between 2
and 3, 3 and 4, &amp;c. The divergence, then, is <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>, and from this
we learn that, starting from any leaf on the axis, we must pass
twice round the stem in a spiral through five leaves before reaching
one directly over that with which we started. The line which, winding
round an axis either to the right or to the left, passes through the
points of insertion of all the leaves on the axis is termed the <i>genetic</i>
or <i>generating spiral</i>; and that margin of each leaf which is towards
the direction from which the spiral proceeds is the <i>kathodic</i> side, the
other margin facing the point
whither the spiral passes being
the <i>anodic</i> side.</p>

<p>In cases where the internodes
are very short and the leaves are
closely applied to each other, as
in the house-leek, it is difficult
to trace the <i>generating spiral</i>.
Thus, in fig. 34 there are thirteen
leaves which are numbered in
their order, and five turns of the
spiral marked by circles in the
centre (<span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">13</span> indicating the arrangement);
but this could not be
detected at once. So also in fir
cones (fig. 35), which are composed
of scales or modified leaves,
the generating spiral cannot be
determined easily. But in such
cases a series of <i>secondary spirals</i>
or <i>parastichies</i> are seen running
parallel with each other both
right and left, which to a certain
extent conceal the genetic spiral.</p>

<p>The spiral is not always constant
throughout the whole
length of an axis. The angle of
divergence may alter either
abruptly or gradually, and the
phyllotaxis thus becomes very
complicated. This change may
be brought about by arrest of
development, by increased development
of parts or by a torsion
of the axis. The former are exemplified in many Crassulaceae and
aloes. The latter is seen well in the screw-pine (<i>Pandanus</i>). In the
bud of the screw-pine the leaves are arranged in three orthostichies
with the phyllotaxis <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, but by torsion the developed leaves become
arranged in three strong spiral rows running round the stem. These
causes of change in phyllotaxis are also well exemplified in the alteration
of an opposite or verticillate arrangement to an alternate, and vice
versa; thus the effect of interruption of growth, in causing alternate
leaves to become opposite and verticillate, can be distinctly shown in
<i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>. The primitive or generating spiral may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>328</span>
pass either from right to left or from left to right. It sometimes
follows a different direction in the branches from that pursued in the
stem. When it follows the same course in the stem and branches,
they are <i>homodromous</i>; when the direction differs, they are <i>heterodromous</i>.
In different species of the same genus the phyllotaxis
frequently varies.</p>

<p>All modifications of leaves follow the same laws of arrangement
as true leaves&mdash;a fact which is of importance in a morphological point
of view. In dicotyledonous plants the first leaves produced (the
cotyledons) are opposite. This arrangement often continues during
the life of the plant, but at other times it changes, passing into
distichous and spiral forms. Some tribes of plants are distinguished
by their opposite or verticillate,
others by their
alternate, leaves. Labiate
plants have decussate
leaves, while Boraginaceae
have alternate
leaves, and Tiliaceae usually
have distichous
leaves; Rubiaceae have
opposite leaves. Such
arrangements as <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>, <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span>, <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">13</span>
and <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">21</span> are common in
Dicotyledons. The first
of these, called a <i>quincunx</i>,
is met with in the
apple, pear and cherry
(fig. 32); the second, in
the bay, holly, <i>Plantago
media</i>; the third, in the
cones of <i>Picea alba</i> (fig.
35); and the fourth in
those of the silver fir.
In monocotyledonous
plants there is only one seed-leaf or cotyledon, and hence
the arrangement is at first alternate; and it generally continues
so more or less, rarely being verticillate. Such arrangements as <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>,
<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> and <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> are common in Monocotyledons, as in grasses, sedges and
lilies. It has been found in general that, while the number 5 occurs
in the phyllotaxis of Dicotyledons, 3 is common in that of Monocotyledons.</p>

<p class="pt2">In the axil of previously formed leaves leaf-buds arise. These
leaf-buds contain the rudiments of a shoot, and consist of leaves
covering a growing point. The buds of trees of temperate climates,
which lie dormant during the winter, are protected by scale leaves.
These scales or protective appendages of the bud consist either of
the altered laminae or of the enlarged petiolary sheath, or of stipules,
as in the fig and magnolia, or of one or two of these parts combined.
These are often of a coarse nature, serving a temporary purpose,
and then falling off when the leaf is expanded. They are frequently
covered with a resinous matter, as in balsam-poplar and horse-chestnut,
or by a thick downy covering as in the willow. In plants
of warm climates the buds have often no protective appendages, and
are then said to be <i>naked</i>.</p>

<p class="pt2">The arrangement of the leaves in the bud is termed <i>vernation</i> or
<i>prefoliation</i>. In considering vernation we must take into account
both the manner in which each individual leaf is folded and also the
arrangement of the leaves in relation to each other. These vary in
different plants, but in each species they follow a regular law. The
leaves in the bud are either placed simply in apposition, as in the
mistletoe, or they are folded or rolled up longitudinally or laterally,
giving rise to different kinds of vernation, as delineated in figs. 36
to 45, where the folded or curved lines represent the leaves, the
thickened part being the midrib. The leaf taken individually is
either folded longitudinally from apex to base, as in the tulip-tree,
and called <i>reclinate</i> or <i>replicate</i>; or rolled up in a circular manner
from apex to base, as in ferns (fig. 36), and called <i>circinate</i>; or folded
laterally, <i>conduplicate</i> (fig. 37), as in oak; or it has several folds
like a fan, <i>plicate</i> or <i>plaited</i> (fig. 38), as in vine and sycamore, and in
leaves with radiating vernation, where the ribs mark the foldings;
or it is rolled upon itself, <i>convolute</i> (fig. 39), as in banana and apricot;
or its edges are rolled inwards, <i>involute</i> (fig. 40), as in violet; or
outwards, <i>revolute</i> (fig. 41), as in rosemary. The different divisions
of a cut leaf may be folded or rolled up separately, as in ferns,
while the entire leaf may have either the same or a different kind of
vernation. The leaves have a definite relation to each other in the
bud, being either opposite, alternate or verticillate; and thus different
kinds of vernation are produced. Sometimes they are nearly in a
circle at the same level, remaining flat or only slightly convex
externally, and placed so as to touch each other by their edges, thus
giving rise to <i>valvate</i> vernation. At other times they are at different
levels, and are applied over each other, so as to be <i>imbricated</i>, as in
lilac, and in the outer scales of sycamore; and occasionally the
margin of one leaf overlaps that of another, while it in its turn is
overlapped by a third, so as to be <i>twisted</i>, <i>spiral</i> or <i>contortive</i>. When
leaves are applied to each other face to face, without being folded or
rolled together, they are <i>appressed</i>. When the leaves are more completely
folded they either touch at their extremities and are <i>accumbent</i>
or <i>opposite</i> (fig. 42), or are folded inwards by their margin and become
<i>induplicate</i>; or a conduplicate leaf covers another similarly folded,
which in turn covers a third, and thus the vernation is <i>equitant</i>
(fig. 43), as in privet; or conduplicate leaves are placed so that the
half of the one covers the half of another, and thus they become
<i>half-equitant</i> or <i>obvolute</i> (fig. 44), as in sage. When in the case of
convolute leaves one leaf is rolled up within the other, it is <i>supervolute</i>
(fig. 45). The scales of a bud sometimes exhibit one kind of
vernation and the leaves another. The same modes of arrangement
occur in the flower-buds.</p>

<p>Leaves, after performing their functions for a certain time, wither
and die. In doing so they frequently change colour, and hence arise
the beautiful and varied tints of the autumnal foliage. This change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>329</span>
of colour is chiefly occasioned by the diminished circulation in the
leaves, and the higher degree of oxidation to which their chlorophyll
has been submitted.</p>

<p>Leaves which are articulated with the stem, as in the walnut and
horse-chestnut, fall and leave a scar, while those which are continuous
with it remain attached for some time after they have lost
their vitality. Most of the trees of Great Britain have deciduous
leaves, their duration not extending over more than a few months,
while in trees of warm climates the leaves often remain for two or
more years. In tropical countries, however, many trees lose their
leaves in the dry season. The period of defoliation varies in different
countries according to the nature of their climate. Trees which are
called evergreen, as pines and evergreen-oak, are always deprived
of a certain number of leaves at intervals, sufficient being left, however,
to preserve their green appearance. The cause of the fall of
the leaf in cold climates seems to be deficiency of light and heat in
winter, which causes a cessation in the functions of the cells of the
leaf. The fall is directly caused by the formation of a layer of tissue
across the base of the leaf-stalk; the cells of this layer separate
from one another and the leaf remains attached only by the fibres
of the veins until it becomes finally detached by the wind or frost.
Before its fall the leaf has become dry owing to loss of water and the
removal of the protoplasm and food substances to the stem for use
next season; the red and yellow colouring matters are products
of decomposition of the chlorophyll. Inorganic and other waste
matters are stored in the leaf-tissue and thus got rid of by the plant.
The leaf scar is protected by a corky change (suberization) in the
walls of the exposed cells.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEAF-INSECT,<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> the name given to orthopterous insects of the
family Phasmidae, referred to the single genus <i>Phyllium</i> and
characterized by the presence of lateral laminae upon the legs
and abdomen, which, in association with an abundance of
green colouring-matter, impart a broad and leaf-like appearance
to the whole insect. In the female this deceptive resemblance
is enhanced by the large size and foliaceous form of the front
wings which, when at rest edge to edge on the abdomen, forcibly
suggest in their neuration the midrib and costae of an ordinary
leaf. In this sex the posterior wings are reduced and functionless
so far as flight is concerned; in the male they are ample,
membranous and functional, while the anterior wings are small
and not leaf-like. The freshly hatched young are reddish in
colour; but turn green after feeding for a short time upon leaves.
Before death a specimen has been observed to pass through the
various hues of a decaying leaf, and the spectrum of the green
colouring matter does not differ from that of the chlorophyll
of living leaves. Since leaf-insects are purely vegetable feeders
and not predaceous like mantids, it is probable that their resemblance
to leaves is solely for purposes of concealment from
enemies. Their egg capsules are similarly protected by their likeness
to various seeds. Leaf-insects range from India to the
Seychelles on the one side, and to the Fiji Islands on the
other.</p>

(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">France</a></span>: <i>History</i>). &ldquo;The Solemn League and Covenant&rdquo;
was the agreement for the establishment of Presbyterianism in
both countries entered into by England and Scotland in 1643
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Covenanters</a></span>). Of commercial leagues the most famous
is that of the Hanse towns, known as the Hanseatic League
(<i>q.v.</i>). The word has been adopted by political associations,
such as the Anti-Corn Law League, the Irish Land League, the
Primrose League and the United Irish League, and by numerous
social organizations. &ldquo;League&rdquo; has also been applied to a
special form of competition in athletics, especially in Association
football. In this system clubs &ldquo;league&rdquo; together in a competition,
each playing every other member of the association
twice, and the order of merit is decided by the points gained during
the season, a win counting two and a draw one.</p>

<p>2. (From the late Lat. <i>leuga</i>, or <i>leuca</i>, said to be a Gallic word;
the mod. Fr. <i>lieue</i> comes from the O. Fr. <i>liue</i>; the Gaelic <i>leac</i>,
meaning a flat stone posted as a mark of distance on a road,
has been suggested as the origin), a measure of distance, probably
never in regular use in England, and now only in poetical
or rhetorical language. It was the Celtic as opposed to the
Teutonic unit, and was used in France, Spain, Portugal and Italy.
In all the countries it varies with different localities, and the
ancient distance has never been fixed. The kilometric league
of France is fixed at four kilometres. The nautical league is
equal to three nautical miles.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEAKE, WILLIAM MARTIN<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> (1777-1860), British antiquarian
and topographer, was born in London on the 14th of
January 1777. After completing his education at the Royal
Military Academy, Woolwich, and spending four years in the
West Indies as lieutenant of marine artillery, he was sent by the
government to Constantinople to instruct the Turks in this branch
of the service. A journey through Asia Minor in 1800 to join the
British fleet at Cyprus inspired him with an interest in antiquarian
topography. In 1801, after travelling across the desert
with the Turkish army to Egypt, he was, on the expulsion
of the French, employed in surveying the valley of the Nile
as far as the cataracts; but having sailed with the ship engaged to
convey the Elgin marbles from Athens to England, he lost all his
maps and observations when the vessel foundered off Cerigo.
Shortly after his arrival in England he was sent out to survey
the coast of Albania and the Morea, with the view of assisting
the Turks against attacks of the French from Italy, and of this
he took advantage to form a valuable collection of coins and
inscriptions and to explore ancient sites. In 1807, war having
broken out between Turkey and England, he was made prisoner
at Salonica; but, obtaining his release the same year, he was
sent on a diplomatic mission to Ali Pasha of Iannina, whose
confidence he completely won, and with whom he remained
for more than a year as British representative. In 1810 he was
granted a yearly sum of ¬£600 for his services in Turkey. In 1815
he retired from the army, in which he held the rank of colonel,
devoting the remainder of his life to topographical and antiquarian
studies, the results of which were given to the world in
the following volumes: <i>Topography of Athens</i> (1821); <i>Journal of
a Tour in Asia Minor</i> (1824); <i>Travels in the Morea</i> (1830), and
a supplement, <i>Peloponnesiaca</i> (1846); <i>Travels in Northern
Greece</i> (1835); and <i>Numismata Hellenica</i> (1854), followed by a
supplement in 1859. A characteristic of the researches of Leake
was their comprehensive minuteness, which was greatly aided
by his mastery of technical details. His <i>Topography of Athens</i>,
the first attempt at a scientific treatment of the subject, is still
authoritative in regard to many important points (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Athens</a></span>).
He died at Brighton on the 6th of January 1860. The marbles
collected by him in Greece were presented to the British Museum;
his bronzes, vases, gems and coins were purchased by the university
of Cambridge after his death, and are now in the Fitzwilliam
Museum. He was elected F.R.S. and F.R.G.S., received
the honorary D.C.L. at Oxford (1816), and was a member of the
Berlin Academy of Sciences and correspondent of the Institute
of France.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEAMINGTON,<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> a municipal borough and health resort of
Warwickshire, England, on the river Leam near its junction
with the Avon, 98 m. N.W. from London, served by the
Great Western and London &amp; North Western railways. Pop.
(1901) 26,888. The parliamentary boroughs of Leamington
and Warwick were joined into one constituency in 1885, returning
one member. The centres of the towns are 2 m.
apart, Warwick lying to the west, but they are united by the
intermediate parish of New Milverton. There are three saline
springs, and the principal pump-rooms, baths and pleasant
gardens lie on the right bank of the river. The chief public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>330</span>
buildings are the town hall (1884), containing a free library
and school of art; and the Theatre Royal and assembly room.
The parish church of All Saints is modernized, and the other
churches are entirely modern. The S. Warwickshire hospital
and Midland Counties Home for incurables are here. Leamington
High School is an important school for girls. There is a municipal
technical school. Industries include iron foundries and brickworks.
The town lies in a well-wooded and picturesque country,
within a few miles of such interesting towns as Warwick, Kenilworth,
Coventry and Stratford-on-Avon. It is a favourite hunting
centre, and, as a health resort, attracts not only visitors
but residents. The town is governed by a mayor, 8 aldermen,
and 24 councillors. Area, 2817 acres.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Leamington was a village of no importance until about 1786,
when baths were first erected, though the springs were noticed by
Camden, writing about 1586. The population in 1811 was only 543,
The town was incorporated in 1875. The name in former use was
Leamington Priors, in distinction from Leamington Hastings, a
village on the upper Leam. By royal licence granted in 1838 it was
called Royal Leamington Spa.</p>

painting under Bin and Cabanel. From 1887 he figured among
the exhibitors of the Salon, where he showed numerous portraits
and genre pictures, but his popular fame is due to his comic
drawings and caricatures. The series of the &ldquo;Gotha des
souverains,&rdquo; published in <i>Le Rire</i>, placed him in the front rank
of modern caricaturists. Besides his contributions to <i>Le Rire</i>,
<i>Le Figaro</i> and other comic journals, he published a series of
albums: <i>Nocturnes</i>, <i>Le Mus√©e des souverains</i>, and <i>Paris et la
province</i>. L√©andre produced admirable work in lithography,
and designed many memorable posters, such as the &ldquo;Yvette
Guilbert.&rdquo; &ldquo;Les nouveaux mari√©s,&rdquo; &ldquo;Joseph Prudhomme,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Les Lutteurs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;La Femme au chien.&rdquo; He was created

<p><span class="bold">LEAP-YEAR<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> (more properly known as <i>bissextile</i>), the name
given to the year containing 366 days. The astronomers of
Julius Caesar, 46 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, settled the solar year at 365 days 6 hours.
These hours were set aside and at the end of four years made a
day which was added to the fourth year. The English name
for the bissextile year is an allusion to the result of the interposition
of the extra day; for after the 29th of February a date
&ldquo;leaps over&rdquo; the day of the week on which it would fall in
ordinary years. Thus a birthday on the 10th of June, a Monday,
will in the next year, if a leap-year, be on the 10th of June, a
Wednesday. Of the origin of the custom for women to woo,
not be wooed, during leap-year no satisfactory explanation has
ever been offered. In 1288 a law was enacted in Scotland that
&ldquo;it is statut and ordaint that during the rein of hir maist blissit
Megeste, for ilk yeare knowne as lepe yeare, ilk mayden ladye of
bothe highe and lowe estait shall hae liberte to bespeke ye man

shall be mulcted in ye sum ane pundis or less, as his estait may be;
except and awis gif he can make it appeare that he is betrothit
ane ither woman he then shall be free.&rdquo; A few years later a like
law was passed in France, and in the 15th century the custom
was legalized in Genoa and Florence.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LEAR, EDWARD<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> (1812-1888), English artist and humorist, was
born in London on the 12th of May 1812. His earliest drawings
were ornithological. When he was twenty years old he published
a brilliantly coloured selection of the rarer Psittacidae. Its
power attracted the attention of the 13th earl of Derby, who
employed Lear to draw his Knowsley menagerie. He became
a permanent favourite with the Stanley family; and Edward,
15th earl, was the child for whose amusement the first <i>Book of
Nonsense</i> was composed. From birds Lear turned to landscape,
his earlier efforts in which recall the manner of J. D. Harding;
but he quickly acquired a more individual style. About 1837
he set up a studio at Rome, where he lived for ten years, with
summer tours in Italy and Sicily, and occasional visits to England.
During this period he began to publish his <i>Illustrated Journals
of a Landscape Painter</i>: charmingly written reminiscences of
wandering, which ultimately embraced Calabria, the Abruzzi,
Albania, Corsica, &amp;c. From 1848-1849 he explored Greece,
Constantinople, the Ionian Islands, Lower Egypt, the wildest
recesses of Albania, and the desert of Sinai. He returned to
London, but the climate did not suit him. In 1854-1855 he
wintered on the Nile, and migrated successively to Corfu, Malta
and Rome, finally building himself a villa at San Remo. From
Corfu Lear visited Mount Athos, Syria, Palestine, and Petra;
and when over sixty, by the assistance of Lord Northbrock,
then Govenor-General, he saw the cities and scenery of greatest
interest within a large area of India. From first to last he was,
in whatever circumstances of difficulty or ill-health, an indomitable
traveller. Before visiting new lands he studied their
geography and literature, and then went straight for the mark;
and wherever he went he drew most indefatigably and most
accurately. His sketches are not only the basis of more finished
works, but an exhaustive record in themselves. Some defect
of technique or eyesight occasionally left his larger oil painting,
though nobly conceived, crude or deficient in harmony; but
his smaller pictures and more elaborate sketches abound in
beauty, delicacy, and truth. Lear modestly called himself a
topographical artist; but he included in the term the perfect
rendering of all characteristic graces of form, colour, and atmosphere.
The last task he set himself was to prepare for popular
circulation a set of some 200 drawings, illustrating from his travels
the scenic touches of Tennyson&rsquo;s poetry; but he did not live
to complete the scheme, dying at San Remo on the 30th of
January 1888. Until sobered by age, his conversation was
brimful of humorous fun. The paradoxical originality and
ostentatiously uneducated draughtsmanship of his numerous
nonsense books won him a more universal fame than his serious
work. He had a true artist&rsquo;s sympathy with art under all forms,
and might have become a skilled musician had he not been a
painter. Swainson, the naturalist, praised young Lear&rsquo;s great
red and yellow macaw as &ldquo;equalling any figure ever painted
by Audubon in grace of design, perspective, and anatomical
accuracy.&rdquo; Murchison, examining his sketches, complimented
them as rigorously embodying geological truth. Tennyson&rsquo;s
lines &ldquo;To E.L. on his Travels in Greece,&rdquo; mark the poet&rsquo;s genuine
admiration of a cognate spirit in classical art. Ruskin placed
the <i>Book of Nonsense</i> first in the list of a hundred delectable
volumes of contemporary literature, a judgment endorsed by
English-speaking children all over the world.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEATHER<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> (a word which appears in all Teutonic languages;
cf. Ger. <i>Leder</i>, Dutch <i>leer</i> or <i>leder</i>, Swed. <i>l√§der</i>, and in such Celtic
forms as Welsh <i>llader</i>), an imputrescible substance prepared
from the hides or skins of living creatures, both cold and warm
blooded, by chemical and mechanical treatment. Skins in the
raw and natural moist state are readily putrescible, and are
easily disintegrated by bacterial or chemical action, and if dried
in this condition become harsh, horny and intractable. The art
of the leather manufacturer is principally directed to overcoming
the tendency to putrefaction, securing suppleness in the material,
rendering it impervious to and unalterable by water, and increasing
the strength of the skin and its power to resist wear and tear.</p>

<p>Leather is made by three processes or with three classes of
substances. Thus we have (1) tanned leather, in which the
hides and skins are combined with tannin or tannic acid; (2)
tawed leather, in which the skins are prepared with mineral salts;
(3) chamoised (shamoyed) leather, in which the skins are rendered
imputrescible by treatment with oils and fats, the decomposition
products of which are the actual tanning agents.</p>

<p><i>Sources and Qualities of Hides and Skins.</i>&mdash;The hides used
in heavy leather manufacture may be divided into
three classes: (1) ox and heifer, (2) cow, (3) bull. Oxen
and heifer hides produce the best results, forming a
<span class="sidenote">Heavy leathers.</span>
tough, tight, solid leather. Cow hides are thin, the hide itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>331</span>
being fibrous, but still compact, and by reason of its spread or
area is used chiefly for dressing purposes in the bag and portmanteau
manufacture and work of a similar description. Bull
hides are fibrous; they are largely used for heel lifts, and for
cheap belting, the thicker hides being used in the iron and steel
industry.</p>

<p>A second classification now presents itself, viz. the British
home supply, continental (Europe), British colonial, South
American, East Indian, Chinese, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the British home supply there are three chief breeds:
(1) Shorthorns (Scotch breed), (2) Herefords (Midland breed),
(3) Lowland, or Dutch class. From a tanner&rsquo;s standpoint, the
shorthorns are the best hides procurable. The cattle are exposed
to a variable climate in the mountainous districts of Scotland,
and nature, adapting herself to circumstances, provides them
with a thicker and more compact hide; they are well grown,
have short necks and small heads. The Hereford class are
probably the best English hide; they likewise have small heads
and horns, and produce good solid sole leather. The Lowland
hides come chiefly from Suffolk, Kent and Surrey; the animals
have long legs, long necks and big heads. The hides are usually
thin and spready. The hides of the animals killed for the
Christmas season are poor. The animals being stall-fed for the
beef, the hides become distended, thin and surcharged with fat,
which renders them unsuitable for first-class work.</p>

<p>The continental supply may be divided into two classes:
(1) Hides from hilly regions, (2) hides from lowlands. All
animals subject to strong winds and a wide range of temperatures
have a very strong hide, and for this reason those bred in hilly
and mountainous districts are best. The hides coming under
heading No. 1 are of this class, and include those from the
Swiss and Italian Alps, Bavarian Highlands and Pyrenees, also
Florence, Oporto and Lisbon hides. They are magnificent hides,
thick, tightly-built, and of smooth grain. The butt is long and
the legs short. A serious defect in some of these hides is a
thick place on the neck caused by the yoke; this part of the
hide is absolute waste. Another defect, specially noticeable in
Lisbon and Oporto hides, is goad marks on the rump, barbed
wire scratches and warbles, caused by the gadfly. Those hides
coming under heading No. 2 are Dutch, Rhine valley, Danish,
Swedish, Norwegian, Hungarian, &amp;c. The first three hides are
very similar; they are spready, poorly grown, and are best used
for bag and portmanteau work. Hungarian oxen are immense
animals, and supply a very heavy bend. Swedish and Norwegian
hides are evenly grown and of good texture; they are well
flayed, and used a great deal for manufacturing picker bands,
which require an even leather.</p>

<p>New Zealand, Australian and Queensland hides resemble good
English. A small quantity of Canadian steers are imported;
these are generally branded.</p>

<p>Chinese hides are exported dry, and they have generally
suffered more or less from peptonization in the storing and
drying; this cannot be detected until they are in the pits, when
they fall to pieces.</p>

<p>Anglos are imported as live-stock, and are killed within forty-eight
hours. They come to Hull, Birkenhead, Avonmouth
and Deptford from various American ports, and usually give
a flatter result than English, the general quality depending
largely on whether the ship has had a good voyage or not.</p>

<p>Among South American hides, Liebig&rsquo;s slaughter supply the
best; they are thoroughly clean and carefully trimmed and
flayed. They come to London, Antwerp and Havre, and except
for being branded are of first-class quality. Second to the
Liebig slaughter come the Uruguay hides.</p>

<p>East Indian hides are known as kips, and are supposed to be,
and should be, the hides of yearling cattle. They are now dressed
to a large extent in imitation of box calf, being much cheaper.
They come from a small breed of ox, and have an extremely
tight grain; the leather is not so soft as calf.</p>

<p>Calf-skins are largely supplied by the continent. They are soft
and pliant, and have a characteristically fine grain, are tight in
texture and quite apart from any other kind of skin.</p>

<p>The most valuable part of a sheepskin is the wool, and the
value of the pelt is inversely as the value of the wool. Pure
Leicester and Norfolk wools are very valuable, and next
is the North and South Downs, but the skins, <i>i.e.</i> the
<span class="sidenote">Light leathers.</span>
pelts, of these animals are extremely poor. Devon
and Cheviot cross-bred sheep supply a fair pelt, and sometimes
these sheep are so many times crossed that it is quite impossible
to tell what the skin is. Welsh skins also supply a good tough
pelt, though small. Indian and Persian sheepskins are very
goaty, the herds being allowed to roam about together so much.
The sheepskin is the most porous and open-textured skin in
existence, as also the most greasy one; it is flabby and soft,
with a tight, compact grain, but an extremely loose flesh. Stillborn
lambs and lambs not over a month old are worth much
more than when they have lived for three months; they are
used for the manufacture of best kid gloves, and must be milk
skins. Once the lambs have taken to grass the skins supply a
harsher leather.</p>

<p>The best goat-skins come from the Saxon and Bavarian
Highlands, Swiss Alps, Pyrenees, Turkey, Bosnia, Southern
Hungary and the Urals. The goats being exposed to all winds
yield fine skins. A good number come from Argentina and from
Abyssinia, the Cape and other parts of Africa. Of all light
leathers the goat has the toughest and tightest grain; it is, therefore,
especially liked for fancy work. The grain is rather too
bold for glac√© work, for which the sheep is largely used.</p>

<p>The seal-skin, used largely for levant work, is the skin of the
yellow-hair seal, found in the Northern seas, the Baltic, Norway
and Sweden, &amp;c. The skin has a large, bold, brilliant grain, and
being a large skin is much used for upholstery and coach work,
like the Cape goat. It is quite distinct from the fur seal.</p>

<p>Porpoise hide is really the hide of the white whale; it is
dressed for shooting, fishing and hunting boots. Horse hide is
dressed for light split and upper work; being so much stall-fed
it supplies only a thin, spready leather. The skins of other
Equidae, such as the ass, zebra, quagga, &amp;c. are also dressed to
some small extent, but are not important sources.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Structure of Skin.</i>&mdash;Upon superficial inspection, the hides and
skins of all mammalia appear to be unlike each other in general
structure, yet, upon closer examination, it is found that the anatomical
structure of most skins is so similar that for all practical purposes
we may assume that there is no distinction (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Skin and Exo-skeleton</a></span>).
But from the practical point of view, as opposed to
the anatomical, there are great and very important differences, such
as those of texture, thickness, area, &amp;c.; and these differences
cause a great divergence in the methods of tanning used, almost
necessitating a distinct tannage for nearly every class of hide or
skin.</p>

<p>The skins of the lower animals, such as alligators, lizards, fish and
snakes, differ to a large extent from those of the mammalia, chiefly
in the epidermis, which is much more horny in structure and
forms scales.</p>

<p>The skin is divided into two distinct layers: (1) the epidermis
or epithelium, <i>i.e.</i> the cuticle, (2) the corium derma, or cutis, <i>i.e.</i>
the true skin. These two layers are not only different in structure,
but are also of entirely distinct origin. The epidermis again divides
itself into two parts, viz. the &ldquo;horny layer&rdquo; or surface skin, and the
<i>rete Malpighi</i>, named after the Italian anatomist who first drew
attention to its existence. The <i>rete Malpighi</i> is composed of living,
soft, nucleated cells, which multiply by division, and, as they
increase, are gradually pushed to the surface of the skin, becoming
flatter and drier as they near it, until they reach the surface as
dried scales. The epidermis is thus of cellular structure, and more
or less horny or waterproof. It must consequently be removed
together with the hair, wool or bristles before tannage begins,
but as it is very thin compared with the corium, this matters little.</p>

<p>The hair itself does not enter the corium, but is embedded in a
sheath of epidermic structure, which is part of and continuous with
the epidermis. It is of cellular structure, and the fibrous part is
composed of long needle-shaped cells which contain the pigment
with which the hair is coloured. Upon removal of the hair some of
these cells remain behind and colour the skin, and this colour does
not disappear until these cells are removed by scudding. Each hair
is supplied with at least two fat or sebaceous glands, which discharge
into the orifice of the hair sheath; these glands impart to
the hair that natural glossy appearance which is characteristic of
good health. The hair bulb (<i>b</i>, fig. 1) consists of living nucleated
cells, which multiply rapidly, and, like the <i>rete Malpighi</i>, cause an
upward pressure, getting harder at the same time, thereby lengthening
the hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span></p>

<p>The hair papilla (<i>a</i>, fig. 1) consists of a globule of the corium or
true skin embedded in the hair bulb, which by means of blood-vessels
feeds and nourishes the hair. Connected with the lower
part of each hair is an oblique muscle known as the arrector or
erector pili, seen at <i>k</i>, fig. 1; this is an involuntary muscle, and is
contracted by sudden cold, heat or shock, with an accompanying
tightening of the skin, producing the phenomenon commonly known
as &ldquo;goose flesh.&rdquo; This is the outcome of the contracted muscle
pulling on the base of the hair, thereby giving it a tendency to
approach the vertical, and producing the simultaneous effect of
making the &ldquo;hair stand on end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sudoriferous or sweat glands (R, fig. 1) consist of long spiral-like
capillaries, formed from the fibres of the connective tissue of
the corium. These glands discharge sometimes directly through
the epidermis, but more often into the orifice of the hair-sheath.</p>

<p>The epidermis is separated from the corium by a very important
and very fine membrane, termed the &ldquo;hyaline&rdquo; or &ldquo;glassy layer,&rdquo;
which constitutes the actual grain surface of a hide or skin. This
layer is chemically different from the corium, as if it is torn or
scratched during the process of tanning the colour of the underlying
parts is much lighter than that of the grain surface.</p>

<p>The corium, unlike the epidermis, is of fibrous, not cellular structure;
moreover, the fibres do not multiply among themselves, but
are gradually developed as needed from the interfibrillar substance,
a semi-soluble gelatinous modification of the true fibre. This
interfibrillar substance
consequently
has no structure,
and is prepared at
any time on coming
into contact with
tannin to form amorphous
leather, which
fills what would in
the absence of this
substance be interfibrillar
spaces. The
more of this matter
there is present the
more completely will
the spaces be filled,
and the more waterproof
will be the
leather. An old bull,
as is well known,
supplies a very poor,
soft and spongy
leather, simply because
the hide lacks
interfibrillar substance,
which has
been sapped up by
the body. The fibres
are, therefore, separated
by interfibrillar
spaces, which on
contact with water
absorb it with
avidity by capillary
attraction. But a
heifer hide or young
calf supplies the
most tight and
waterproof leather
known, because the
animals are young, and having plenty of nourishment do not
require to draw upon and sap the interfibrillar substance with
which the skin is full to overflowing.</p>

<p>The corium obtains its food from the body by means of lymph
ducts, with which it is well supplied. It is also provided with
nodules of lymph to nourish the hair, and nodules of grease, which
increase in number as they near the flesh side, until the net skin,
<i>panniculus adiposus</i>, or that which separates the corium from meat
proper, is quite full with them.</p>

<p>The corium is coarse in the centre of the skin where the fibres,
which are of the kind known as white connective tissue, and which
exist in bundles bound together with yellow elastic fibres, are
loosely woven, but towards the flesh side they become more compact,
and as the hyaline layer is neared the bundles of fibres get
finer and finer, and are much more tightly interwoven, until finally,
next the grain itself, the fibres no longer exist in bundles, but as
individual fibrils lying parallel with the grain. This layer is known
as the <i>pars papillaris</i>. The bundles of fibre interweave one another
in every conceivable direction. The fibrils are extremely minute,
and are cemented together with a medium rather more soluble
than themselves.</p>

<p>There are only two exceptions to this general structure which
need be taken into account. Sheep-skin is especially loosely woven
in the centre, so much so that any carelessness in the wet work or
sweating process enables one to split the skin in two by tearing.
This loosely-woven part is full of fatty nodules, and the skin is
generally split at this part, the flesh going for chamois leather
and the grain for skivers. The other notable exception is the horse
hide, which has a third skin over the loins just above the kidneys,
known as the crup; it is very greasy and tight in structure, and
is used for making a very waterproof leather for seamen&rsquo;s and
fishermen&rsquo;s boots. Pig-skin, perhaps, is rather peculiar, in the fact
that the bristles penetrate almost right through the skin.</p>

<p><i>Tanning Materials.</i>&mdash;Tannin or tannic acid is abundantly formed
in a very large number of plants, and secreted in such diverse organs
and members as the bark, wood, roots, leaves, seed-pods, fruit, &amp;c.
The number of tannins which exists has not been determined, nor
has the constitution of those which do exist been satisfactorily
settled. As used in the tanyard tannin is present both in the free
state and combined with colouring matter and accompanied by
decomposition products, such as gallic acid or phlobaphenes (anhydrides
of the tannins), respectively depending upon the series to
which the tannin belongs. In whatever other points they differ,
they all have the common property of being powerfully astringent,
of forming insoluble compounds with gelatine or gelatinous tissue,
of being soluble in water to a greater or lesser extent, and of forming
blacks (greenish or bluish) with iron. Pyrogallol tannins give a
blue-black coloration or precipitate with ferric salts, and catechol
tannins a green-black; and whereas bromine water gives a precipitate
with catechol tannins, it does not with pyrogallol tannins.
There are two distinctive classes of tannins, viz. catechol and
pyrogallol tannins. The materials belonging to the former series
are generally much darker in colour than those classified with the
latter, and moreover they yield reds, phlobaphenes or tannin anhydrides,
which deposit on or in the leather. Pyrogallol tannins
include some of the lightest coloured and best materials known,
and, speaking generally, the leather produced by them is not so
harsh or hard as that produced with catechol tannins. They decompose,
yielding ellagic acid (known technically as &ldquo;bloom&rdquo;) and
gallic acid; the former has waterproofing qualities, because it fills
the leather, at the same time giving weight.</p>

<p>It has been stated, and perhaps with some truth, that leather
cannot be successfully made with catechol tannins alone; pyrogallol
tannins, however, yield an excellent leather; but the finest results
are obtained by blending the two.</p>

<p>Myrobalans are the fruit of an Indian tree. There are several
different qualities, the order of which is as follows, the best being
placed first: Bhimley, Jubbalpore, Rajpore, Fair Coast Madras
and Vingorlas. They are a very light-coloured material, containing
from 27 % to 38 % of tannin; they deposit much &ldquo;bloom,&rdquo; ferment
fairly rapidly, supplying acidity, and yield a mellow leather.</p>

<p>Chestnut comes on the market in the form of crude and decolorized
liquid extracts, containing about 27 % to 31 % of tannin, and
yields a good leather of a light-brown colour.</p>

<p>Oakwood reaches the market in the same form; it is a very
similar material, but only contains 24 % to 27 % of tannin, and
yields a slightly heavier and darker leather.</p>

<p>Divi-divi is the dried seed pods of an Indian tree containing
40 % to 45 % of tannin, and yielding a white leather; it might be
valuable but for the tendency to dangerous fermentation and development
of a dark-red colouring matter.</p>

<p>Algarobilla consists of the seeds of an Indian tree, containing
about 45 % of tannin, and in general properties is similar to divi-divi,
but does not discolour so much upon fermentation.</p>

<p>Sumach is perhaps the best and most useful material known.
It is the ground leaves of a Sicilian plant, containing about 28 % of
tannin, and yielding a nearly white and very beautiful leather. It
is used alone for tanning the best moroccos and finer leather, and
being so valuable is much adulterated, the chief adulterant being
<i>Pistacia lentiscus</i> (Stinko or Lentisco), an inferior and light-coloured
catechol tannin. Other but inferior sumachs are also used. There
is Venetian sumach (<i>Rhus cotinus</i>) and Spanish sumach (<i>Colpoon
compressa</i>); these are used to some extent in the countries bordering
on the Mediterranean. <i>R. Glabra</i> and <i>R. Copallina</i> are also used in
considerable quantities in America, where they are cultivated.</p>

<p>Galls are abnormal growths found upon oaks, and caused by the
gall wasp laying eggs in the plant. They are best harvested just
before the insect escapes. They contain from 50 % to 60 % of
tannin, and are generally used for the commercial supply of tannic
acid, and not for tanning purposes.</p>

<p>Gambier, terra japonica or catechu, is the product of a shrub
cultivated in Singapore and the Malay Archipelago. It is made by
boiling the shrub and allowing the extract to solidify. It is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span>
peculiar material, and may be completely washed out of a leather
tanned with it. It mellows exceedingly, and keeps the leather fibre
open; it may be said that it only goes in the leather to prepare
and make easy the way for other tannins. Block gambier contains
from 35 % to 40 % and cube gambier from 50 % to 65 % of tannin.</p>

<p>Hemlock generally reaches the market as extract, prepared from
the bark of the American tree. It contains about 22 % of tannin,
has a pine-like odour, but yields a rather dark-coloured red leather.</p>

<p>Quebracho is imported mainly as solid extract, containing 63 %
to 70 % of tannin; it is a harsh, light-red tannage, but darkens
rapidly on exposure to light. It is used for freshening up very
mellow liquors, but is rather wasteful, as it deposits an enormous
amount of its tannin as phlobaphenes.</p>

<p>Mangrove or cutch is a solid extract prepared from the mangrove
tree found in the swamps of Borneo and the Straits Settlements;
it contains upwards of 60 % of a red tannin.</p>

<p>Mimosa is the bark of the Australian golden wattle (<i>Acacia
pycnantha</i>), and contains from 36 % to 50 % of tannin. It is a
rather harsh tannage, yielding a flesh-coloured leather, and is useful
for sharpening liquors. This bark is now successfully cultivated in
Natal. The tannin content of this Natal bark is somewhat inferior,
but the colour is superior to the Australian product.</p>

<p>Larch bark contains 9 % to 10 % of light-coloured tannin, and
is used especially for tanning Scotch basils.</p>

<p>Canaigre is the air-dried tuberous roots of a Mexican plant,
containing 25 % to 30 % of tannin and about 8 % of starch. It
yields an orange-coloured leather of considerable weight and firmness.
Its cultivation did not pay well enough, so that it is little
used.</p>

<p>Cutch, catechu or &ldquo;dark catechu,&rdquo; is obtained from the wood
of Indian acacias, and is not to be confounded with mangrove cutch.
It contains 60 % of tanning matter and a large proportion of catechin
similar to that contained in gambier, but much redder. It is used
for dyeing browns and blacks with chrome and iron mordants.</p>

<p>The willow and the white birch barks contain, respectively, 12 %
to 14 % and 2 % to 5 % of tannin. In combination they are used
to produce the famous Russia leather, whose insect-resisting odour
is due to the birch bark. In America this leather is imitated with
the American black birch bark (<i>Betula lenta</i>), and also with the oil
obtained from its dry distillation.</p>

<p>In the list of materials two have been placed in a subsidiary class
because they are a mixture of catechol and pyrogallol tannin. Oak
bark produces the best leather known, proving that a blend of the
two classes of tannins gives the best results. It is the bark of the
coppice oak, and contains 12 % to 14 % of a reddish-yellow tannage.
Valonia is the acorn cup of the Turkish and Greek oak. The Smyrna
or Turkish valonia is best, and contains 32 % to 36 % of an almost
white tannin. Greek valonia is greyer in colour, and contains 26 %
to 30 % of tannin. It yields a tough, firm leather of great weight,
due to the rapid deposition of a large amount of bloom.</p>

<p><i>Grinding and Leaching</i><a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> <i>Tanning Materials.</i>&mdash;At first sight it would
not seem possible that science could direct such a clumsy process as
the grinding of tanning materials, and yet even here, the &ldquo;scientific
smashing&rdquo; of tanning materials may mean the difference between
profit and loss to the tanner. In most materials the tannin exists
imprisoned in cells, and is also to some extent free, but with this
latter condition the science of grinding has nothing to do. If tanning
materials are simply broken by a series of clean cuts, only those cells
directly on the surfaces of the cuts will be ready to yield their tannin;
therefore, if materials are ground by cutting, a proportion of the
total tannin is thrown away. Hence it is necessary to bruise, break
and otherwise sever the walls of all the cells containing the tannin;
so that the machine wanted is one which crushes, twists and cuts
the material at the same time, turning it out of uniform size and with
little dust.</p>

<p>The apparatus in most common use is built on the same principle
as the coffee mill, which consists of a series of segmental cutters;
as the bark works down into the smaller cutters of the mill it is
twisted and cut in every direction. This is a very good form of mill,
but it requires a considerable amount of power and works slowly.
The teeth require constant renewal, and should, therefore, be
replaceable in rows, not, as in some forms, cast on the bell. The
disintegrator is another form of mill, which produces its effect by
violent concussion, obtained by the revolution in opposite directions
of from four to six large metal arms fitted with projecting spikes
inside a drum, the faces of which are also fitted with protruding
pieces of metal. The arms make from 2000 to 4000 revolutions per
minute. The chief objection to this apparatus is that it forms
much dust, which is caught in silken bags fitted to gratings in the
drum. The myrobalans crusher, a very useful machine for such
materials as myrobalans and valonia, consists of a pair of toothed
rollers above and a pair of fluted rollers beneath. The material is
dropped upon the toothed rollers first, where it is broken and crushed;
then the crushing is finished and any sharp corners rounded off in
the fluted rollers.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that now the material is ground it is
necessarily ready for leaching. This may or may not be so, depending
upon whether the tanner is making light or heavy leathers.
If light leathers are being considered, it is ready for immediate
leaching, <i>i.e.</i> to be infused with water in preparation of a liquor.
If heavy leathers are in process of manufacture, he would be a very
wasteful tanner who would extract his material raw. It must be
borne in mind that when an infusion is made with fresh tanning
material, the liquor begins to deposit decomposition products after
standing a day or two, and the object of the heavy-leather tanner
is to get this material deposited in the leather, to fill the pores,
produce weight and make a firm, tough product. With this end in
view he dusts his hides with this fresh material in the layers, <i>i.e.</i>
he spreads a layer between each hide as it is laid down, so that the
strong liquors penetrate and deposit in the hides. When most of
this power to deposit has been usefully utilized in the layers, then
the material (which is now, perhaps, half spent) is leached. The
light-leather maker does not want a hard, firm leather, but a soft
and pliable product; hence he leaches his material fresh, and does
not trouble as to whether the tannin deposits in the pits or not.</p>

<p>Whether fresh or partially spent material is leached, the process
is carried out in the same way. There are several methods in vogue;
the best method only will be described, viz. the &ldquo;press leach&rdquo;
system.</p>

<p>The leaching is carried out in a series of six square pits, each
holding about 3 to 4 tons of material. The method depends upon
the fact that when a weak liquor is forced over a stronger one they
do not mix, by reason of the higher specific gravity of the stronger
one; the weaker liquor, therefore, by its weight forces the stronger
liquor downwards, and as the pit in which it is contained is fitted
with a false bottom and side duct running over into the next pit,
the stronger liquor is forced upwards through this duct on to the
next stronger pit. There the process is repeated, until finally the
weak liquor or water, as the case may be, is run off the last vat as
a very strong infusion. As a concrete example let us take the six
pits shown in the figure.</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:253px; height:106px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img333.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">No. 6 is the last vat, and the liquor, which is very strong, is about
to be run off. No. 1 is spent material, over which all six liquors
have passed, the present liquor having been pumped on as fresh
water. The liquor from No. 6 is run off into the pump well, and
liquor No. 1 is pumped over No. 2, thus forcing all liquors one
forward and leaving pit No. 1 empty; this pit is now cast and filled
with clean fishings and perhaps a little new material, clean water is
then pumped on No. 2, which is now the weakest pit, and all liquors
are thus forced forward one pit more, making No. 1 the strongest
pit. After infusing for some time this is run off to the pump well,
and the process repeated. It may be noted that the hotter the
water is pumped on the weakest pit, the better will the material
be spent, and the nearer the water is to boiling-point the better;
in fact, a well-managed tanyard should have the spent tan down
to between 1% and 2% of tannin, although this material is frequently
thrown away containing up to 10% and sometimes even
more. There is a great saving of time and labour in this method,
since the liquors are self-adjusting.</p>

<p><i>Testing Tan Liquors.</i>&mdash;The methods by which the tanning value
of any substance may be determined are many, but few are at once
capable of simple application and minute accuracy. An old method
of ascertaining the strength of a tan liquor is by means of a hydrometer
standardized against water, and called a barkometer. It
consists of a long graduated stem fixed to a hollow bulb, the opposite
end of which is weighted. It is placed in the liquor, the weighted
end sinks to a certain depth, and the reading is taken on the stem
at that point which touches &ldquo;water mark.&rdquo; The graduations are
such that if the specific gravity is multiplied by 1000 and then 1000
is subtracted from the result, the barkometer strength of the liquor
is obtained. Thus 1029 specific gravity equals 29¬∞ barkometer.
This method affords no indication of the amount of tannin present,
but is useful to the man who knows his liquors by frequent analysis.</p>

<p>A factor which governs the quality of the leather quite as much
as the tannin itself is the acidity of the liquors. It is known that
gallic and tannic acids form insoluble calcium salts, and all the
other acids present as acetic, propionic, butyric, lactic, formic, &amp;c.,
form comparatively soluble salts, so that an easy method of determining
this important factor is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take a quantity, say 100 c.c., of tan liquor, filter till clear through
paper, then pipette 10 c.c. into a small beaker (about 1¬Ω in. diameter),
place it on some printed paper and note how clear the
print appears through the liquor; now gradually add from a burette
a clear solution of saturated lime water until the liquor becomes
just cloudy, that is until it just loses its brilliancy. Now read off
the number of cubic centimetres required in the graduated stem of
the burette, and either read as degrees (counting each c.c. as one
degree), to which practice at once gives a useful signification, or
calculate out in terms of acetic acid per 100 c.c. of liquor, reckoning
saturated lime water as <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span> normal.</p>

<p>The methods which deal with the actual testing for tannin itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span>
depend mostly upon one or other of two processes; either the
precipitation of the tannin by means of gelatin, or its absorption
by means of prepared hide. Sir Humphry Davy was the first to
propose a method for analysing tanning materials, and he precipitated
the tannin by means of gelatin in the presence of alum,
then dried and weighed the precipitate, after washing free from
excess of reagents. This method was improved by Stoddart,
but cannot lay claim to much accuracy. Warington and M√ºller
again modified the method, but their procedure being tedious
and difficult to work could not be regarded as a great advance.
Wagner then proposed precipitation by means of the alkaloids,
with special regard to cinchonine sulphate in the presence of
rosaniline acetate as indicator, but this method also proved useless.
After this many metallic precipitants were tried, used gravimetrically
and volumetrically, but without success. The weighing
of precipitated tannates will never succeed, because the tannins are
such a diverse class of substances that each tannin precipitates
different quantities of the precipitants, and some materials contain
two or three different tannins. Then there are also the difficulties
of incomplete precipitation and the precipitation of colouring
matter, &amp;c. Among this class of methods may be mentioned
Garland&rsquo;s, in which tartar emetic and sal ammoniac were employed.
It was improved by Richards and Palmer.</p>

<p>Another class of methods depends upon the destruction of the
tannin by some oxidizing agent, and the estimation of the amount
required. Terreil rendered the tannin alkaline, and after agitating
it with a known quantity of air, estimated the volume of oxygen
absorbed. The method was slow and subject to many sources of
error. Commaille oxidized with a known quantity of iodic acid and
estimated the excess of iodate. This process also was troublesome,
besides oxidizing the gallic acid (as do all the oxidation processes),
and entailing a separate estimation of them after the removal of
the tannin. Ferdinand Jean (1877) titrated alkaline tannin solution
with standard iodine, but the mixture was so dark that the end
reaction with starch could not be seen; in addition the gallic acid
had again to be estimated. Monier proposed permanganate as an
oxidizing agent, and Lowenthal made a very valuable improvement
by adding indigo solution to the tannin solution, which controlled
the oxidation and acted as indicator. This method also required
double titration because of the gallic acid present, the tanning
matters being removed from solution by means of gelatin and
acidified salt.</p>

<p>The indirect gravimetric hide-powder method first took form
about 1886. It was published in <i>Der Gerber</i> by Simand and Weiss,
other workers being Eitner and Meerkatz. Hammer, Muntz and
Ramspacher did some earlier work on similar lines, depending upon
the specific gravity of solutions. Professor H. R. Procter perfected
this method by packing a bell, similar in shape to a bottomless
bottle of about 2 oz. (liq.) capacity, with the hide-powder, and siphoning
the tan liquor up through the powder and over into a receiver.
This deprives the tan liquor of tannin, and a portion of this non-tannin
solution is evaporated to dryness and weighed till constant;
similarly a portion of the original solution containing non-tannins
and tannins is evaporated and weighed till constant; then the
weight of the non-tannins subtracted from the weight of the non-tannins
and tannins gives the weight of tannin, which is calculated
to percentage on original solutions. This method was adopted as
official by the International Association of Leather Trades Chemists
until September 1906, when its faults were vividly brought before
them by Gordon Parker of London and Bennett of Leeds, working
in collaboration, although other but not so complete work had been
previously done to the same end. The main faults of the method
were that the hide-powder absorbed non-tannins, and therefore
registered them as tannins, and the hide-powder was partially
soluble. This difficulty has now been overcome to a large extent
in the present official method of the I.A.L.T.C.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Parker and Munro Payne proposed a new method
of analysis, the essence of which is as follows:&mdash;A definite excess
of lime solution is added to a definite quantity of tannin solution
and the excess of lime estimated; the tan solution is now deprived
of tannin by means of a soluble modification of gelatin, called
&ldquo;collin,&rdquo; and the process is repeated. Thus we get two sets of
figures, viz. total absorption and acid absorption (<i>i.e.</i> acids other
than tan); the latter subtracted from the former gives tannin
absorption, and this is calculated out in percentage of original
liquor. The method failed theoretically, because a definite molecular
weight had to be assumed for tannins which are all different.
There are also several other objections, but though, like the hide-powder
method, it is quite empirical, it gives exceedingly useful
results if the rules for working are strictly adhered to.</p>

<p>The present official method of the I.A.L.T.C. is a modification of
the American official method, which is in turn a modification of a
method proposed by W. Eitner, of the Vienna Leather Research
Station. The hide-powder is very slightly chrome-tanned with a
basic solution of chromium chloride, 2 grammes of the latter being
used per 100 grammes of hide-powder, and is then washed free from
soluble salts and squeezed to contain 70% of moisture, and is
ready for use. This preliminary chroming does away with the
difficulty of the powder being soluble, by rendering it quite insoluble;
it also lessens the tendency to absorb non-tannins. Such
a quantity of this wet powder as contains 6.5 grammes of dry hide
is now taken, and water is added until this quantity contains exactly
20 grammes of moisture, <i>i.e.</i> 26.5 grammes in all; it is then agitated
for 15 minutes with 100 c.c. of the prepared tannin solution, which
is made up to contain tannin within certain definite limits, in a
mechanical rotator, and filtered. Of this non-tannin solution 50 c.c.
is then evaporated to dryness. The same thing is done with 50 c.c.
of original solution containing non-tannins and tannins, and both
residues are weighed. The tannin is thus determined by difference.
The method does all that science can do at present. The rules for
carrying out the analysis are necessarily very strict. The object in
view is that all chemists should get exactly concordant results,
and in this the I.A.L.T.C. has succeeded.</p>

<p>The work done by Wood, Trotman, Procter, Parker and others
on the alkaloidal precipitation of tannin deserves mention.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Heavy Leathers.</i>&mdash;The hides of oxen are received in the tanyard
in four different conditions: (1) market or slaughter hides,
which, coming direct from the local abattoirs, are soft, moist and
covered with dirt and blood; (2) wet salted hides; (3) dry salted
hides; (4) sun-dried or &ldquo;flint&rdquo; hides&mdash;the last three forms
being the condition in which the imports of foreign hides are
made. The first operation in the tannery is to clean the hides
and bring them back as nearly as possible to the flaccid
condition in which they left the animal&rsquo;s back. The blood and
other matter on market hides must be removed as quickly as
possible, the blood being of itself a cause of dark stains and bad
grain, and with the other refuse a source of putrefaction. When
the hides are sound they are given perhaps two changes of water.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Salted hides need a longer soaking than market hides, as it is
not only essential to remove the salt from the hide, but also necessary
to plump and soften the fibre which has been partially dehydrated
and contracted by the salt. It must also be borne in mind that a
10 % solution of salt dissolves hide substance, thereby causing an
undesirable loss of weight, and a weak solution prevents plumping,
especially when taken into the limes, and may also cause &ldquo;buckling,&rdquo;
which cannot easily be removed in after processes. Dried and dry
salted hides require a much longer soaking than any other variety.
Dried hides are always uncertain, as they may have putrefied before
drying, and also may have been dried at too high a temperature;
in the former case they fall to pieces in the limes, and in the latter
case it is practically impossible to soak them back, unless putrefactive
processes are used, and such are always dangerous and difficult to
work because of the Rivers Pollution Acts. Prolonged soaking in
cold water dissolves a serious amount of hide substance. Soaking
in brine may be advantageous, as it prevents putrefaction to some
extent. Caustic soda, sodium sulphide and sulphurous acid may
also be advantageously employed on account of their softening and
antiseptic action. In treating salted goods, the first wash water
should always be rapidly changed, because, as mentioned, strong
salt solutions dissolve hide; four changes of water should always
be given to these goods.</p>

<p>There are other and mechanical means of softening obstinate
material, viz. by stocking. The American hide mill, or double-acting
stocks, shown
diagrammatically in fig.
2, is a popular piece of
apparatus, but the goods
should never be subjected
to violent mechanical
treatment until
soft enough to stand it,
else severe grain cracking
may result. Perhaps
the use of sodium sulphide
or caustic soda in
conjunction with the
American wash wheel is
the safest method.</p>

<p>Whatever means are
used the ultimate object
is first to swell and open
up the fibres as much
as possible, and secondly
to remove putrefactive
refuse and dirt, which
if left in is fixed by the lime in the process of depilation, and causes
a dirty buff.</p>
</div>

<p>After being thus brought as nearly as possible into a uniform
condition, all hides are treated alike. The first operation to
which they are subjected is <i>depilation</i>, which removes not only
the hair but also the scarf skin or epidermis. When the goods are
sent to the limes for depilation they are, first of all, placed in an
old lime, highly charged with organic matter and bacteria.
It is the common belief that the lime causes the hair to loosen and
fall out, but this is not so; in fact, pure lime has the opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>335</span>
effect of tightening the hair. The real cause of the loosening
of the hair is that the bacteria in the old lime creep down the
hair, enter the <i>rete Malpighi</i> and hair sheath, and attack and
decompose the soft cellular structure of the sheath and bulb,
also altering the composition of the <i>rete Malpighi</i> by means of
which the scarf skin adheres to the true skin. These products
of the bacterial action are soluble in lime, and immediately
dissolve, leaving the scarf skin and hair unbound and in a condition
to leave the skin upon scraping. In this first &ldquo;green&rdquo; lime
the action is mainly this destructive one, but the goods have yet
to be made ready to receive the tan liquor, which they must enter
in a plump, open and porous condition. Consequently, the
&ldquo;green&rdquo; lime is followed with two more, the second being less
charged with bacteria, and the third being, if not actually a new
one, a very near approach to it; in these two limes the bundles
of fibre are gradually softened, split up and distended, causing the
hide to swell, the interfibrillar substance is rendered soluble
and the whole generally made suitable for transference to the
tan liquors. The hide itself is only very slightly soluble; if care
is taken, the grease is transformed into an insoluble calcium
soap, and the hair is hardly acted upon at all.</p>

<p>The time the goods are in the limes and the method of making
new limes depends upon the quality of the leather to be turned
out. The harder and tougher the leather required the shorter
and fresher the liming. For instance, for sole leather where a
hard result is required, the time in the limes would be from
8 to 10 days, and a perfectly fresh top lime would be used,
with the addition of sodium sulphide to hasten the process.
Every tanner uses a different quantity of lime and sulphide,
but a good average quantity is 7 &#8468; lime per hide and 10-15 &#8468;
sodium sulphide per pit of 100 hides. The lime is slaked with
water and the sulphide mixed in during the slaking; if it is added
to the pit when the slaking is finished the greater part of its
effect is lost, as it does not then enter into the same chemical
combinations with the lime, forming polysulphides, as when it is
added during the process of slaking.</p>

<p>For softer and more pliable leathers, such as are required
for harness and belting, a &ldquo;lower&rdquo; or mellower liming is given,
and the time in the limes is increased from 9 to 12 days. Some
of the old mellow liquor is added to the fresh lime in the making,
so as just to take off the sharpness. It would be made up as
for sole leather, but with less sulphide or none at all, and then
a dozen buckets of an old lime would be added. For lighter
leathers from 3 to 6 weeks&rsquo; liming is given, and a fresh lime is
never used.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Sweating&rdquo; as a method of depilation is obsolete in England so
far as heavy leathers are concerned. It consists of hanging the goods
in a moist warm room until incipient putrefaction sets in. This
first attacks the more mucous portions, as the <i>rete Malpighi</i>, hair
bulb and sheath, and so allows the hair to be removed as before.
The method pulls down the hide, and the putrefaction may go
too far, with disastrous results, but there is much to recommend
it for sheepskins where the wool is the main consideration, the main
point being that while lime entirely destroys wool, this process
leaves it intact, only loosening the roots. It is consequently still
much used.</p>

<p>Another method of fellmongering (dewooling) sheepskins is to
paint the flesh side with a cream of lime made with a 10% solution
of sodium sulphide and lay the goods in pile flesh to flesh, taking
care that none of the solution comes in contact with the wool, which
is ready for pulling in from 4 to 8 hours. Although this process may
be used for any kind of skin, it is practically only used for sheep,
as if any other skin is depilated in this manner all plumping effect
is lost. Since this must be obtained in some way, it is an economy
of time and material to place the goods in lime in the first instance.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the commoner classes of sole leather, the hair is
removed by painting the hair side with cream of lime and sulphide,
or the same effect is produced by drawing the hides through a strong
solution of sulphide; this completely destroys the hair, actually
taking it into solution. But the hair roots remain embedded in the
skin, and for this reason such leather always shows a dirty buff.</p>

<p>Arsenic sulphide (realgar) is slaked with the lime for the production
of the finer light leathers, such as glace kid and glove kid.
This method produces a very smooth grain (the tendency of sodium
sulphide being to make the grain harsh and bold), and is therefore
very suitable for the purpose, but it is very expensive.</p>

<p>Sufficient proof of the fact that it is not the lime which causes
skins to unhair is found in the process of chemical liming patented
by Payne and Pullman. In this process the goods are first treated
with caustic soda and then with calcium chloride; in this manner
lime is formed in the skin by the reaction of the two salts, but
still the hair remains as tight as ever. If this process is to be used
for unhairing and liming effect, the goods must be first subjected
to a putrid soak to loosen the hair, and afterwards limed. Experiments
made by the present writer also prove this theory. A piece
of calf skin was subjected to sterilized lime for several months, at
the end of which time the hair was as tight as ever; then bacterial
influence was introduced, and the skin unhaired in as many days.</p>

<p>After liming it is necessary to unhair the goods. This is done
by stretching a hide over a tanner&rsquo;s beam (fig. 3), when with an
unhairing knife (a, fig. 4) the beamsman partially scrapes and
partially shaves off the hair and epidermis. Another workman,
a &ldquo;flesher,&rdquo; removes the flesh or &ldquo;net skin&rdquo; (<i>panniculus
adiposus</i>), a fatty matter from the flesh side of the skin, with the
fleshing knife (two-edged),
seen in <i>b</i>, fig.
4. For these operations
several
machines have been
adapted, working
mostly with revolving
spiral blades or
vibrating cutters,
under which the
hides pass in a fully
extended state.
Among these may
be mentioned the
Leidgen unhairer,
which works on a
rubber bed, which
&ldquo;gives&rdquo; with the
irregularities of the
hide, and the Wilson flesher, consisting of a series of knives
attached to a revolving belt, and which also &ldquo;give&rdquo; in contact
with irregularities.</p>

<p>At this stage the hide is divided into several parts, the process
being known as &ldquo;rounding.&rdquo; The object of the division is this:
certain parts of the hide termed the &ldquo;offal&rdquo; are of less value
than the &ldquo;butt,&rdquo; which consists of the prime part. The grain
of the butt is fine and close in texture, whereas the offal grain is
loose, coarse and open, and if the offal is placed in the same
superior liquors as the butt, being open and porous, it will
absorb the best of the tannin first; consequently the offal goes
to a set of inferior liquors, often consisting of those through
which the butts have passed. The hides are &ldquo;rounded&rdquo; with
a sharp curved butcher&rsquo;s knife; the divisions are seen in fig. 5.
The bellies, cheeks and
shoulders constitute the offal,
and are tanned separately although
the shoulder is not often
detached from the butt until
the end of the &ldquo;suspenders,&rdquo;
being of slightly better quality
than the bellies. The butt is
divided into two &ldquo;bends.&rdquo;
This separation is not made
until the tanning of the butt
is finished, when it is cut in
two, and the components sold as &ldquo;bends,&rdquo; although as often as
not the butt is not divided. In America the hides are only
split down the ridge of the back, from head to tail, and tanned
as hides. Dressing hides are more frequently rounded after
tanning, the mode depending on the purpose for which the
leather is required.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: left; width: 410px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figleft1"><img style="width:359px; height:440px" src="images/img336a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 5.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>The next step is to remove as much &ldquo;scud&rdquo; and lime as
possible, the degree of removal of the latter depending upon the
kind of leather to be turned out. &ldquo;Scudding&rdquo; consists of
working the already unhaired hide over the beam with an
unhairing knife with increased pressure, squeezing out the dirt,
which is composed of pigment cells, semi-soluble compounds of
lime, and hide, hair sacks and soluble hide substance, &amp;c. This
exudes as a dirty, milky, viscid liquid, and mechanically brings the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>336</span>
lime out with it, but involves a great and undesirable loss
of hide substance, heavy leather being sold by weight. This
difficulty is now got over by giving the goods an acid bath first,
to delime the surface; the acid fixes this soluble hide substance
(which is only soluble in alkalies) and hardens it, thus preventing
its loss, and the goods may then be scudded clean with safety.
The surface of all heavy leathers must be delimed to obtain a
good coloured leather, the demand of the present day boot
manufacturer; it is also necessary to carry this further with
milder leathers than
sole, such as harness
and belly, &amp;c., as
excess of lime causes
the leather to crack
when finished. Perhaps
the best
material for this
purpose is boracic
acid, using about
10 &#8468; per 100 butts,
and suspending the
goods. This acid
yields a characteristic
fine grain, and
because of its limited
solubility cannot be
used in excess. Other
acids are also used,
such as acetic, lactic,
formic, hydrochloric, with
varying
success. Where the
water used is very
soft, it is only necessary to wash in water for a few hours, when
the butts are ready for tanning, but if the water is hard, the
lime is fixed in the hide by the bicarbonates it contains, in the
form of carbonate, and the result is somewhat disastrous.</p>

<p>After deliming, the butts are scudded, rinsed through water
or weak acid, and go off to the tan pits for tanning proper. Any
lime which remains is sufficiently removed by the acidity of the
early tan liquors.</p>

<p>The actual tanning now begins, and the operations involved
may be divided into a series of three: (1) colouring, (2) handling,
(3) laying away.</p>

<p>The colouring pits or &ldquo;suspenders,&rdquo; perhaps a series of eight
pits, consist of liquors ranging from 16¬∞ to 40¬∞ barkometer, which
were once the strongest liquors in the yard, but have gradually
worked down, having had some hundreds of hides through them;
they now contain very little tannin, and consist mainly of
developed acids which neutralize the lime, plump the hide,
colour it off, and generally prepare it to receive stronger liquors.
The goods are suspended in these pits on poles, which are lifted
up and down several times a day to ensure the goods taking an
even colour; they are moved one pit forward each day into
slightly stronger liquors, and take about from 7 to 18 days to get
through the suspender stage.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The reason why the goods are suspended at this stage instead of
being laid flat is that if the latter course were adopted, the hides
would sink and touch one another, and the touch-marks, not being
accessible to the tan liquor, would not colour, and uneven colouring
would thus result; in addition the weight of the top hides would
flatten the lower ones and prevent their plumping, and this condition
would be exceedingly difficult to remedy in the after liquors.
Another question which might occur to the non-technical reader is,
why should not the process be hastened by placing the goods in
strong liquors? The reason is simple. Strong tanning solutions
have the effect of &ldquo;drawing the grain&rdquo; of pelt, <i>i.e.</i> contracting the
fibres, and causing the leather to assume a very wrinkled appearance
which cannot afterwards be remedied; at the same time &ldquo;case
tanning&rdquo; results, <i>i.e.</i> the outside only gets tanned, leaving the
centre still raw hide, and once the outside is case-hardened it is
impossible for the liquor to penetrate and finish the tanning. This
condition being almost irremediable, the leather would thus be
rendered useless.</p>
</div>

<tr><td class="caption1"><span class="sc">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Tanner&rsquo;s Hook
(without handle).</td></tr></table>

<p>After the &ldquo;suspenders&rdquo; the goods are transferred to a series
of &ldquo;handlers&rdquo; or &ldquo;floaters,&rdquo; consisting of, perhaps, a dozen
pits containing liquors ranging from 30¬∞ to 55¬∞ barkometer.
These liquors contain an appreciable quantity of both tannin
and acid, once formed the &ldquo;lay-aways,&rdquo; and are destined to
constitute the &ldquo;suspenders.&rdquo; In these pits the goods, having
been evenly coloured off, are laid flat, handled every day in the
&ldquo;hinder&rdquo; (weaker) liquors and shifted forward, perhaps every
two days, at the tanner&rsquo;s convenience. The &ldquo;handling&rdquo;
consists of lifting the butts out of the pit by means of a tanner&rsquo;s
hook (fig. 6), piling them on the side of the pit to drain, and returning
them to the pit, the top butt in
the one handler being returned as the
bottom in the next. This operation
is continued throughout the process,
only, as the hides advance, the necessity
for frequent handling decreases.
The top two handler pits are sometimes converted into
&ldquo;dusters,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> when the hides have advanced to these pits,
as each butt is lowered, a small quantity of tanning material is
sprinkled on it.</p>

<p>Some tanners, now that the hides are set flat, put them in
suspension again before laying away; the method has its
advantages, but is not general. The goods are generally laid
away immediately. The layer liquors consist of leached liquors
from the fishings, strengthened with either chestnut or oakwood
extract, or a mixture of the two. The first layer is made up
to, say, 60¬∞ barkometer in this way, and as the hides are laid
down they are sprinkled with fresh tanning material, and remain
undisturbed for about one week. The second layer is a 70¬∞
barkometer liquor, the hides are again sprinkled and allowed
to lie for perhaps two weeks. The third may be 80¬∞ barkometer
and the fourth 90¬∞, the goods being &ldquo;dusted&rdquo; as before, and
lying undisturbed for perhaps three or four weeks respectively.
Some tanners give more layers, and some give less, some more or
less time, or greater or lesser strengths of liquor, but this tannage
is a typical modern one.</p>

<p>As regards &ldquo;dusting&rdquo; material, for mellow leather, mellow
materials are required, such as myrobalans being the mellowest
and mimosa bark the most astringent of those used in this
connexion. For harder leather, as sole leather, a much smaller
quantity of myrobalans is used, if any at all, a fair quantity of
mimosa bark as a medium, and much valonia, which deposits a
large amount of bloom, and is of great astringency. About 3 to
4 cwt. of a judicious mixture is used for each pit, the mellower
material predominating in the earlier liquors and the most
astringent in the later liquors.</p>

<p>The tanning is now finished, and the goods are handled out
of the pits, brushed free from dusting material, washed up in
weak liquor, piled and allowed to drip for 2 or 3 days so that the
tan may become set.</p>

<p><i>Finishing.</i>&mdash;From this stage the treatment of sole leather
differs from that of harness, belting and mellower leathers.
As regards the first, it will be found on looking at the dripping
pile of leather that each butt is covered with a fawn-coloured
deposit, known technically as &ldquo;bloom&rdquo;; this disguises the under
colour of the leather, just like a coat of paint. The theory of the
formation of this bloom is this. Strong solutions of tannin, such
as are formed between the hides from dusting materials, are not
able to exist for long without decomposition, and consequently
the tannin begins to condense, and forms other acids and insoluble
anhydrides; this insoluble matter separates in and on the
leather, giving weight, firmness, and rendering the leather waterproof.
It is known technically as bloom and chemically as
ellagic acid.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>After dripping, the goods are scoured free from surface bloom in
a Wilson scouring machine, and are then ready for bleaching.
There are several methods by which this is effected, or, more correctly
several materials or mixtures are used, the method of application
being the same, viz. the goods are &ldquo;vatted&rdquo; (steeped) for some
hours in the bleaching mixture at a temperature of 110¬∞ F. The
mixture may consist of either sumach and a light-coloured chestnut
extract made to 110¬∞ barkometer, and 110¬∞ F., or some bleaching
extract made for the purpose, consisting of bisulphited liquid
quebracho, which bleaches by reason of the free sulphurous acid it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>337</span>
contains. The former method is best (though more expensive), as
it removes less weight, and the light shade of colour is more permanent
than that obtained by using bisulphited extracts.</p>

<p>After the first vatting the goods are laid up in pile to drip;
meanwhile the liquor is again heated, and they are then returned for
another twenty-four hours, again removed and allowed to drip for
2 to 3 days, after which they are oiled with cod oil on the grain and
hung up in the sheds to dry in the dark. When they have dried to
an india-rubber-like condition, they are piled and allowed to heat
slightly until a greyish &ldquo;bloom&rdquo; rises to the surface, they are then
set out and stretched in a Wilson scouring machine; using brass
slickers instead of the stone ones used for scouring, &ldquo;pinned&rdquo; over
by hand (with the three-edged instrument seen in c, fig. 4, and
known as a &ldquo;pin&rdquo;) to remove any bloom not removed by the
machine, oiled and dried. When of a damp even colour they are
&ldquo;rolled on&rdquo; between two heavy rollers like a wringing machine, the
pressure being applied from above, hung up in the dark sheds again
until the uneven colour so produced has dried in, and then &ldquo;rolled
off&rdquo; through the same machine, the pressure being applied from
below. They are now dried right out, brushed on the grain to
produce a slight gloss, and are finished.</p>
</div>

<p>As regards the finishing of harness leather, &amp;c., the goods,
after thorough dripping for a day or two, are brushed, lightly
scoured, washed up in hot sumach and extract to improve the
colour, and are again laid up in pile for two days; they are then
given a good coat of cod oil, sent to the sheds, and dried right
out. Only sufficient scouring is given to clean the goods, the
object of the tanner being to leave as much weight in as possible,
although all this superfluous tan has to be washed out by the
currier before he can proceed.</p>

<p><i>Currying.</i>&mdash;When the goods are dried from the sheds they are
purchased by the currier. If, as is often the case, the tanner is
his own currier, he does not tan the goods so heavily, or trouble
about adding superfluous weight, but otherwise the after processes,
the art of the currier, are the same.</p>

<p>Currying consists of working oil and grease into the leather
to render it pliable and increase its strength. It was once thought
that this was a mere physical effect produced by the oil, but such
is not the case. Currying with animal oils is a second tannage
in itself; the oils oxidize in the fibres and produce aldehydes,
which are well-known tanning agents; and this double tannage
renders the leather very strong. Then there is the lubricating
effect, a very important physical action so far as the strength
of the leather is concerned. Mineral oils are much used, but
they do not oxidize to aldehydes, or, for the matter of that,
to anything else, as they are not subject to decomposition.
They, therefore, produce no second tannage, and their action
is merely the physical one of lubrication, and this is only more
or less temporary, as, except in the case of the heavier greases,
they slowly evaporate. Where animal fats and oils are used,
the longer the goods are left in contact with the grease the better
and stronger will be the leather.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Einbrennen&rdquo; process (German for &ldquo;burning in&rdquo;),
the hides are thoroughly scoured, and when dry are dipped into
hot grease, which is then allowed to cool; when it is nearly set
the goods are removed and set out. This process is not much
used in Great Britain.</p>

<p>In hand-stuffing belting butts the goods are first thoroughly
soaked in water to which has been added some soda, and then
scoured and stretched by machine. They are then lightly shaved,
to take off the loose flesh and thin the neck. The whole of the
mechanically deposited tannin is removed by scouring, to make
room for the grease, and they are then put into a sumach vat
of 40¬∞ barkometer to brighten the colour, horsed up to drip,
and set out. If any loading, to produce fictitious weight, is to be
done, it is done now, by brushing the solution of either epsom
salts, barium chloride or glucose, or a mixture, into the flesh,
and laying away in pile for some days to allow of absorption,
when, perhaps, another coat is given. Whether this is done or
not, the goods are hung up until &ldquo;tempered&rdquo; (denoting a
certain degree of dryness), and then treated with dubbin. This
is manufactured by melting down tallow in a steam-jacketed pan,
and adding cod oil, the mixture being stirred continually; when
quite clear, it is cooled as rapidly as possible by running cold
water through the steam pan, the stirring being continued until
it has set. The tempered leather having been set out on a glass
table, to which the flesh side adheres, is given a thin coat of the
dubbin on the grain, turned, set out on the flesh, and given a
thick coat of dubbin. Then it is hung up in a wind shed, and as
the moisture dries out the grease goes in. After two or three
days the goods are &ldquo;set out in grease&rdquo; with a brass slicker,
given a coat of dubbin on the grain slightly thicker than the
first coat, then flesh dubbined, a slightly thinner coat being
applied than at first, and stoved at 70¬∞ F. The grease which is
slicked off when &ldquo;setting out in grease&rdquo; is collected and sold.
After hanging in the warm stove for 2 or 3 days the butts are
laid away in grease for a month; they are then slicked out
tight, flesh and grain, and buck tallowed. Hard tallow is first
rubbed on the grain, when a slight polish is induced by rubbing
with the smoothed rounded edge of a thick slab of glass; they are
then hung up in the stove or stretched in frames to dry. A
great deal of stuffing is now carried out by drumming the goods
in hot hard fats in previously heated drums; and in modern
times the tedious process of laying away in grease for a month is
either left undone altogether or very considerably shortened.</p>

<p>In the tanning and dressing of the commoner varieties of kips
and dried hides, the materials used are of a poorer quality, and
the time taken for all processes is cut down, so that whereas the
time taken to dress the better class of leather is from 7 to 10
months, and in a few cases more, these cheaper goods are turned
out in from 3¬Ω to 5 months.</p>

<p>A considerable quantity of the leather which reaches England,
such as East India tanned kips, Australian sides, &amp;c., is bought up
and retanned, being sold then as a much better-class leather.
The first operation with such goods is to &ldquo;strip&rdquo; them of any
grease they may contain, and part of their original tannage.
This is effectually carried out by first soaking them thoroughly,
laying them up to drip, and drumming for half an hour in a weak
solution of soda; they are then washed by drumming in plenty of
water, the water is run off and replaced by very weak sulphuric
acid to neutralize any remaining soda; this is in turn run off and
replaced by weak tan liquor, and the goods are so tanned by
drumming for some days in a liquor of gradually increasing
strength. The liquor is made up as cheaply as possible with
plenty of solid quebracho and other cheap extract, which is
dried in with, perhaps, glucose, epsom salts, &amp;c. to produce
weight. Sometimes a better tannage is given to goods of fair
quality, in which they are, perhaps, started in the drum and
finished in layers, slightly better materials being used all through,
and a longer time taken to complete the tannage.</p>

<p>The tannage of dressing hides for bag and portmanteau
work is rather different from the other varieties described,
in that the goods, after having had a rather longer liming,
are &ldquo;bated&rdquo; or &ldquo;puered.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Bating consists of placing the goods in a wheel or paddle with hen
or pigeon excrement, and paddling for from a few hours to 2 or 3
days. In puering, dog manure is used, and this being rather more
active, the process does not take so long. This bating or puering is
carried out in warm liquors, and the actions involved are several.
From a practical point of view the action is the removal of the lime
and the solution of the hair sacs and a certain amount of interfibrillar
substance. In this way the goods are pulled down to a
soft flaccid condition, which allows of the removal of short hair,
hair sacs and other filth by scudding with an unhairing knife
upon the beam. The lime is partially taken into solution and
partially removed mechanically during the scudding. A large
quantity of hide substance, semi-soluble and soluble, is lost by being
pressed out, but this matters little, as for dressing work, area, and
not weight, is the main consideration. Theoretically the action is
due to bacteria and bacterial products (organized ferments and
enzymes), unorganized ferments or vegetable ferments like the yeast
ferment, such as pancreadine, pepsin, &amp;c. and chemicals, such as
ammonium and calcium salts and phosphates, all of which are
present in the manure. The evolved gases also play their part in
the action.</p>

<p>There are several bates upon the market as substitutes for dung
bate. A most popular one was the American &ldquo;Tiffany&rdquo; bate,
made by keeping a weak glue solution warm for some hours and
then introducing a piece of blue cheese to start fermentation; when
fermenting, glucose was added, and the bate was then ready for
work. This and all other bates have been more or less supplanted by
&ldquo;erodin,&rdquo; discovered after years of research by Mr Wood (Nottingham)
and Drs Popp and Becker (Vienna). This is an artificial bate,
containing the main constituents of the dung bate. It is supplied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>
in the form of a bag of nutrient material for bacteria to thrive on
and a bottle of bacterial culture. The nutrient material is dissolved
in water and the bacterial culture added, and after allowing the
mixture to get working it is ready for use. Many tons of this bate
are now being used per annum. Its advantages are: (1) that it is
clean, (2) that it is under perfect control, and (3) that stains and
bate burns, which so often accompany the dung bate, are absolutely
absent. Bate burns are caused by not filtering the dung bate
through coarse sacking before use. The accumulation of useless
solid matter settles on the skins if they are not kept well in motion,
causing excessive action in these places.</p>
</div>

<p>After pulling down the goods to a soft, silky condition by
bating or puering, it is necessary, after scudding, to plump them
up again and bring them into a clean and fit condition for receiving
the tan. This is done by &ldquo;drenching&rdquo; in a bran drench.
A quantity of bran is scalded and allowed to ferment. When the
fermentation has reached the proper stage the goods are placed,
together with the bran liquor, in a suitable pit or vat, and are
allowed to remain until they have risen three times; this rising
to the surface is caused by the gaseous products of the fermentation
being caught by the skin. The plumping action of the bran
is due to the acids produced during fermentation and also in
part to the gases, and the cleansing action is due to the mechanical
action of the particles of bran rubbing against the grain of the
skins. After drenching, the goods are washed free from bran,
and are ready for the tanning process.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Drenching, now that all kinds of acids are available, is not so
much used for heavy hides as for light skins, it being found much
more convenient and cheaper to use acids. In fact, bating and
puering are being gradually replaced by acid baths in the case of
heavy leathers, the process being carried out as deliming for sole
leather, only much more thoroughly in the case of dressing leather.</p>
</div>

<p>The tanning of dressing hides, which are not rounded into butts
and offal, is briefly as follows. They first enter a series of colouring
pits or suspenders, and then a series of handlers, by which
time they should be plump and coloured through; in this condition
they are split either by means of a union or band-knife
splitting machine (fig. 7).</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Band Knife Splitting Machine.</td></tr></table>

<div class="condensed">
<p>This latter is the most popular machine, and consists essentially
of an endless band knife <i>a</i>, which revolves at considerable speed
with its cutting edges close to the sides of a pair of rollers through
which the leather is fed and pressed against the knife. The lower
of these rollers is made of short segments or rings, each separately
capable of yielding so as to accommodate itself to the unequal
thicknesses of various parts of a hide. The thickness of the leather
to be cut is gauged to the utmost minuteness by means of the hand
screws <i>b b</i> which raise or lower the upper roller. The knife edge of
the cutter is kept keen by rubbing against revolving emery wheels
<i>c</i> as it passes round. So delicately can this machine effect its work
that slices of leather uniform throughout and as thin as paper can
be easily prepared by it, and by its aid it is quite common to split
hides into as many as three useful splits.</p>
</div>

<p>The dressing hides are usually split in two. Here we will leave
the split (flesh) for a time and continue with the treatment of the
grain. After splitting, they enter another series of handlers, are
then piled up for a day or two, and thrown into a large drum
with sumach mixed to a paste with hot water and a light-coloured
extract. They are drummed in this for one hour to brighten and
mellow the grain, washed up in tepid liquor, piled for two days,
and drummed with cod oil or some other suitable oil or mixture;
they are now piled for a day or two to absorb, dried out, flattened
on the grain, and flesh folded.</p>

<p>The splits are rinsed up in old sumach liquor and drummed
with cheap extracts and adulterants, such as size, glucose, barium
chloride, epsom salts, &amp;c. after which they are piled up to drain,
dried to a &ldquo;sammied&rdquo; condition, rolled to make firm, and dried
right out.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the dressing hide tannage very mellow materials are used.
Gambier and myrobalans form the main body of the tannage,
together with a little quebracho extract, mimosa bark, sumach
and extracts.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Upper Leather.</i>&mdash;Under the head of upper leather are included
the thin, soft and pliable leathers, which find their principal,
but by no means exclusive, application in making the uppers
of boots and shoes, which may be taken as a type of a class of
leathers. They are made from such skins as East Indian kips,
light cow and horse hides, thin split hides, such as those described
under dressing leather, but split rather thinner, and calf. The
preparatory dressing of such skins and the tanning operations
do not differ essentially from those already described. In proportion
to the thinness of the skin treated, the processes are
more rapidly finished and less complex, the tannage is a little
lighter, heavy materials such as valonia being used sparsely
if at all. Generally speaking, the goods have a longer and
mellower liming and bating, the lime being more thoroughly
removed than for the leathers previously described, to produce
greater pliability, and everything must tend in this direction.
The heavier hides and kips are split as described under dressing
leather, and then tanned right out.</p>

<p><i>Currying of the Lighter Leathers.</i>&mdash;The duty of the currier is
not solely directed towards heavier leathers; he is also entrusted
with the dressing and fitting of the lighter leathers for the
shoemaker, coachbuilder, saddler, &amp;c. He has to pare the leather
down and reduce inequalities in thickness, to impregnate it with
fatty matter in order to render it soft and pliable, and to give it
such a surface dressing, colour and finish as will please the eye
and suit the purposes of its consumers. The fact that machinery
is used by some curriers for nearly every mechanical operation,
while others adhere to the manual system, renders it almost
impossible to give in brief an outline of operations which will be
consistent with any considerable number of curriers.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The following may be taken as a typical modern dressing of
waxed calf or waxed kips. The goods are first of all soaked down
and brought to a &ldquo;sammied&rdquo; condition for shaving. In the better-class
leathers hand-shaving is still adhered to, as it is maintained
that the drag of the shaving machine on the leather causes the
&ldquo;nap&rdquo; finish to be coarser. Hand-shaving is carried out on a
beam or strong frame of wood, supporting a stout plank faced with
lignum vitae, and set vertically, or nearly so. The knife (fig. 8) is
a double-edged rectangular blade about 12 in. by 5 in., girded on
either side along its whole length and down the centre with two
bars 3 in. wide, leaving each
blade protruding 1 in. beyond
them; it has a straight
handle at one end and a cross
handle at the other in the
plane of the blade. The edges
of this knife are first made
very keen, and are then turned
over so as to form a wire edge,
by means of the thicker of the
two straight steel tools shown
in fig. 9. The wire edge is
preserved by drawing the thinner of the two steel tools along
the interior angle of the wire edge and then along the outside
of the turnover edge. The skin being thrown flesh uppermost
over the vertical beam, the shaver presses his body against it,
and leaning over the top holds the knife by its two handles almost
at right angles to the leather, and proceeds to shave it by a
scraping stroke downwards which the wire edge, being set at right
angles to the knife and almost parallel with the skin, turns into a
cut. The skin is shifted so as to bring all parts under the action of
the knife, the shaver frequently passing a fold between his finger
to test the progress of his work. After shaving, the goods are
thoroughly soaked, allowed to drip, and are ready for &ldquo;scouring.&rdquo;
This operation has for its object the removal of bloom (ellagic acid)
and any other superfluous adherent matter. The scouring solution
consists of a weak solution of soft soap and borax. This is first
well brushed into the flesh of the leather, which is then &ldquo;sleeked&rdquo;
(slicked) out with a steel slicker shown at S fig. 9. The upper part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>339</span>
of the &ldquo;slicker&rdquo; is wooden, and into it a steel, stone, brass or
vulcanite blade is forced and fastened. The wooden part is grasped
in both hands, and the blade is half rubbed and half scraped over
the surface of the leather in successive strokes, the angle of the
slicker being a continuation of the angle which the thrust out arms
of the worker form with the body, perhaps 30¬∞ to 45¬∞, with the
leather, depending upon the pressure to be applied. The soap and
borax solution is continually dashed on the leather to supply a body
for the removal of the bloom with the steel slicker. The hide is now
turned, and the grain is scoured with a stone slicker and brush, with
soap and borax solution, it is then rinsed up, and sent to dry; when
sammied, it is &ldquo;set&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the grain is laid smooth with a brass or
steel slicker and dried right out. It is now ready for &ldquo;stuffing,&rdquo;
which is invariably done in the drum with a mixture of stearine and
&ldquo;sod&rdquo; oil, to which is sometimes added cod oil and wool fat; it is
then set out on the grain and &ldquo;canked&rdquo; on the flesh, the grain side
is glassed, and the
leather dried right
out. The goods are
now &ldquo;rounded,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
the lighter coloured
parts of the grain are
damped with a mixture
of dubbin and
water to bring them
to even colour, and
are then laid in pile
for a few days to mellow,
when they are
ready for whitening. The goods are damped down and got to the
right temper with a weak soap and water solution, and are then
&ldquo;whitened,&rdquo; an operation similar to shaving, carried out with a
turned edge slicker. By this means a fine flesh surface is obtained
upon which to finish by waxing; after this they are &ldquo;boarded&rdquo;
with an arm board (R, fig. 9) to bring up the grain, or give a granular
appearance to the leather and make it supple, when they may be
turned flesh inwards and bruised, a similar operation to graining,
essentially to soften and make them pliant. At this stage the
goods are known as &ldquo;finished russet,&rdquo; and are stored until ready
for waxing.</p>

<tr><td class="caption1"><span class="sc">Fig 9.</span>&mdash;Currying Apparatus. C, pommel;
R, raising board; S, slicker.</td></tr></table>

<p>For waxing, the first operation is to black the goods. In England
this is generally done by hand, but machinery is much more used
in the United States. The process consists of well brushing into the
flesh side of the skins a black preparation made in one of two ways.
The older recipe is a mixture of lampblack, oil and perhaps a little
tallow; the newer recipe consists of soap, lampblack, logwood
extract and water. Either of these is brushed well into the flesh
side, which is then glassed up by means of a thick slab of glass, the
smooth rounded edges being used with a slicking motion, and the
goods are hung up to dry. When dry they are oiled with cod oil,
and are ready for sizing. Goods blacked with soap blacking are
sized once, those prepared with oil blacking are sized twice. The
size used for soap black skins may consist of a mixture of beeswax,
pitch, linseed oil, tallow, soap, glue and logwood extract. For oil
blacked skins the &ldquo;bottom sizing&rdquo; may be glue, soap, logwood
extract and water, after the application of which the goods are
dried and the &ldquo;top sizing&rdquo; applied; this consists of glue, cod oil,
beeswax, tallow, venice turps, black dye and water. The sizings
having been applied with a sponge or soft brush, thoroughly rubbed
in with a glass slicker, crush marks are removed by padding with a
soft leather pad, and the goods, after being dried out, are ready
for the market.</p>

<p>In the dressing of waxed grain leathers, such as French calf, satin
leather, &amp;c., the preparatory processes are much the same as for
waxed leathers described above as far as stuffing, after which the
grain is prepared to take the colour by light hand scouring with weak
soap and borax solution. The dye is now applied, and so that it
may take well on the grain of the greasy leather, a quantity of
either soap, turkey red oil or methylated spirit is added to the
solution. Acid colours are preferably used, and three coats are
given to the dry leather, which is then grained with an arm board,
and finished by the application of hard buck tallow to the grain
and brushing. The dye or stain may consist of aniline colours for
coloured leathers, or, in the case of blacks, consecutive applications
of logwood and iron solutions are given.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Finishing dressing Hides for Bag and Portmanteau Work.</i>&mdash;The
hides as received from the tanner are soaked down, piled
to sammy, and shaved, generally by machine, after which
they are scoured, as under waxed leather, sumached and hung
up to dry; when just damp they are set out with a brass slicker
and dried right out. The grain is now filled by applying a solution
of either Irish moss, linseed mucilage or any other mucilaginous
filling material, and the flesh is sized with a mixture of
mucilage and French chalk, after which the goods are brush-stained
with an aniline dye, to which has been added linseed
mucilage to give it body; two coats are applied to the sammied
leather. When the goods have sammied, after the last coat of
stain, they are &ldquo;printed&rdquo; with a brass roller in a &ldquo;jigger,&rdquo; or
by means of a machine embosser. This process consists of imprinting
the grain by pressure from a brass roller, on which
the pattern is deeply etched. After printing, the flesh side is
sponged with a weak milk solution, lightly glassed and dried,
when the grain is sponged with weak linseed mucilage, almost
dried, and brushed by machine. The hides are now finished,
by the application either of pure buck tallow or of a mixture of
carnauba wax and soap; this is rubbed up into a slight gloss
with a flannel.</p>

<p><i>Light Leathers.</i>&mdash;So far only the heavier leathers have been
dealt with; we will now proceed to discuss lighter calf, goat,
sheep, seal, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In tanning light leathers everything must tend towards
suppleness and pliability in the finished leather, in contrast to the
firmness and solidity required in heavy leathers. Consequently,
the liming is longer and mellower; puering, bating or some
bacterial substitute always follows; the tannage is much shorter;
and mellow materials are used. A deposition of bloom in the
goods is not often required, so that very soon after they are
struck through they are removed as tanned. The materials
largely used are sumach, oak bark, gambier, myrobalans, mimosa
bark, willow, birch and larch barks.</p>

<p>As with heavy leathers, so also with light leathers, there are
various ways of tanning; and quality has much to do with the
elaboration or modification of the methods employed. The tanning
of all leathers will be dealt with first, dyeing and finishing
operations being treated later.</p>

<p>The vegetable-tanned leather <i>de luxe</i> is a bottle-tanned skin.
It is superior to every other class of vegetable-tanned leather
in every way, but owing to competition not a great deal is now
produced, as it is perhaps the most expensive leather ever put
on the market. The method of preparation is as follows.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 350px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:291px; height:267px" src="images/img339b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;Dash Wheel.</td></tr></table>

<p>The skins are usually hard and dry when received, so they are
at once soaked down, and when sufficiently soft are either milled
in the stocks, drummed in a lattice drum (American dash wheel,
fig. 10), or &ldquo;broken down&rdquo; over the beam by working on the
flesh with a blunt unhairing knife. They are next mellow limed
(about 3 weeks), sulphide being used if convenient, unhaired and
fleshed as described under heavy leathers, and are then ready
for puering. This process is carried through at about 80¬∞ F.,
when the goods are worked on the beam, rinsed, drenched in a
bran drench, scudded, and are ready for tanning. The skins
are now folded down the centre of the back from neck to butt
(tail end), flesh outwards, and the edges are tightly stitched all
round to form bags, leaving
an aperture at one of
the shanks for filling; they
are now turned grain outwards
and filled with strong
sumach liquor and some
quantity of solid sumach
to fill up the interstices
and prevent leakage, after
which the open shank is
tied up, and they are
thrown into warm sumach
liquor, where they float
about like so many pigs,
being continually pushed
under the surface with a
dole. When struck through they are piled on a shelf above
the vat, and by their own weight the liquor is forced through
the skins. The tannage takes about 24 hours, and when finished
the stitching is ripped up, the skins are slicked out, &ldquo;strained&rdquo;
on frames and dried. &ldquo;Straining&rdquo; consists of nailing the skins
out on boards in a stretched condition, or the stretching in
frames by means of strings laced in the edge of the frame and
attached to the edge of the skin.</p>

<p>The commoner sumach-tanned skins (but still of very good
quality) are tanned in paddle wheels, a series of three being most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span>
conveniently used in the same manner as the three-pit system
of liming, each wheel having three packs of skins through it
before being thrown away. This paddling tends to make a
bolder grain, as the skins are kept in continual motion, and work
over one another. Some manufacturers finish the tannage with
a mixture of sumach and oak bark; this treatment yields a less
porous product. Others, when the skins are strained and in a
semi-dry condition, apply neatsfoot or other oil, or a mixture
of glycerine and oil, to the grain to lubricate it and make it more
supple; the glycerine mixture is generally used for &ldquo;chrome&rdquo;
leather, and will be discussed later under that head.</p>

<p>The skins tanned as above are largely dressed as <i>morocco</i>.
Originally &ldquo;morocco&rdquo; was produced by the Moors in southern
Spain and Morocco, whence the industry spread to the Levant,
Turkey and the Mediterranean coast of Africa generally, where
the leather was made from a species of sumach. Peculiarly
enough, the dyeing was carried out before the tanning, with
Roman alum as &ldquo;mordant&rdquo; and kermes, which with the alum
produced a fine red colour. Such leather was peculiarly clear
in colour, elastic and soft, yet firm and fine in grain and texture,
and has long been much prized for bindings, being the material
in which most of the artistic work of the 16th-century binders
was executed. Now, in addition to the genuine morocco made
from goat skins, we have imitation or French moroccos, for
which split calf and especially sheep skins are employed, and as
the appearance of morocco is the result of the style of graining
and finish, which can now be imitated by printing or embossing
machines, morocco can be made from all varieties of thin leather.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Great quantities of &ldquo;Persian&rdquo; (East India tanned) sheep and
goat are now dressed as moroccos and for innumerable other purposes,
the method being as follows: The goods are tanned with turwar
bark and cassia bark, besides being impregnated with sesame oil,
even to the extent of 30%. The first operation is to &ldquo;strip&rdquo;
them of the oil and original tannage as far as possible, by drumming
in a solution of soda; the soap thus formed is got rid of by thoroughly
washing the goods, when they are &ldquo;soured&rdquo; in a weak bath of
sulphuric acid to brighten the colour and remove iron stains, after
which they are washed up and re-tanned by drumming in warm
sumach, allowing about 4 oz. per skin. They are then slicked out,
dried and are ready for dyeing.</p>

<p>The tanning of sheep and lamb skins differs very essentially
from the tanning of goat and other leathers, mainly in the preparatory
processes. As the wool is completely destroyed by lime, other
methods have to be resorted to. The process usually practised is
known as &ldquo;sweating&rdquo;; this consists of hanging the moist skins up
in a warm, badly-ventilated chamber and allowing incipient putrefaction
to set in. The chamber is always kept warm and saturated
with moisture, either by means of a steam jet or water sprinklers.
During the process large quantities of ammoniacal vapours are
given off, and after two or three days the skins become slimy to the
touch, and the wool slips easily; at this stage the goods are removed,
for if the putrefaction goes too far the grain of the skin is irretrievably
ruined. The wool is now &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; by pullers, who throw it
into bins arranged to receive the different qualities; for one pelt
may have three different grades of wool on it.</p>

<p>Other methods of dewooling are to paint the flesh with a solution
of sodium sulphide, or cream of lime made with a solution of sodium
sulphide; in either case the goods are piled flesh to flesh for an hour
or so, and care is taken that the dewooling agent does not touch the
wool. The pelt is then pulled and rapidly swilled in a stream of
running water. The goods are now, in some yards, lightly limed
to plump them superficially, by paddling in a milk of lime, and at
this stage, or when the goods have been &ldquo;struck through&rdquo; with
tan liquor, they are &ldquo;degreased&rdquo; either by hydraulic pressure or
by benzene degreasing. This is to expel the oleaginous or fatty
matter with which sheep skins are richly impregnated; the average
yield is about 4 oz. per skin. The tannage is carried out in much
the same way as for goat skins, the goods being started in old acid
bark liquors; the general tannage consists of sumach and bark.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Basils</i> are sheep skins tanned in various ways. English basils
are tanned with oak bark, although, as in all other leathers,
inferior tannages are now common; Scotch basils are tanned
with larch bark, Australian and New Zealand basils with mimosa
bark and Turkish basils with galls. The last are the commonest
kind of skins imported into Great Britain, and are usually only
semi-tanned. <i>Roans</i> are sumach-tanned sheep skins.</p>

<p><i>Skivers</i> are the grain splits of sheep skins, the fleshes of which
are finished for chamois leather. The goods are split in the limed
state, just as the grains are ready for tanning, and are subsequently
treated much as sumach-tanned goat skins, or in any
other convenient way; the fleshes, on the other hand, go back
into the limes, as it is necessary to get a large quantity of lime
into leather which is to be finished as chamois.</p>

<p><i>Russia Leather</i> was originally a speciality of Russia, where it
was made from the hides of young cattle, and dressed either a
brownish red or black colour for upper leather, bookbinding,
dressing-cases, purses, &amp;c. It is now made throughout Europe
and America, the best qualities being obtained from Austria.
The empyreumatic odour of the old genuine &ldquo;Russia&rdquo; leather
was derived from a long-continued contact with willow and the
bark of the <i>white</i> birch, which contains the odorous betulin oil.
Horse hides, calf, goat, sheep skins and even splits are now
dressed as &ldquo;Russia leather,&rdquo; but most of these are of a decidedly
inferior quality, and as they are merely treated with birch bark
oil to give them something of the odour by which Russia leather
is ordinarily recognized, they scarcely deserve the name under
which they pass. The present-day genuine Russia leather is
tanned like other light leathers, but properly in willow bark,
although poplar and spruce fir barks are used. After tanning
and setting out the goods are treated with the empyreumatic oil
obtained by the dry distillation of birch bark. The red colour
commonly seen in Russia leather is now produced by aniline
colours, but was originally gained by the application of an infusion
of Brazil wood, which was rubbed over the grain with a
brush or sponge. Some time ago Russia leather got into disrepute
because of its rapid decay; this was owing to its being dyed with
a very acid solution of tin salts and cochineal, the acid completely
destroying the leather in a year or two. The black leather is
obtained by staining with logwood infusion and iron acetate.
The leather, if genuine quality, is very watertight and strong,
and owing to its impregnation with the empyreumatic oil, it
wards off the attacks of insects.</p>

<p><i>Seal Leathers, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The tannage of seal skins is now an
important department of the leather industry of the United
Kingdom. The skins form one of the items of the whaling
industry which principally centres in Dundee, and at that port,
as well as at Hull and Peterhead, they are received in large
quantities from the Arctic regions. This skin is that of the white
hair seal, and must not be confused with the expensive seal
fur obtained from Russian and Japanese waters. These white
hair seal skins are light but exceedingly close in texture, yielding
a very strong tough leather of large area and fine bold grain,
known as <i>Levant morocco</i>. The area of the skins renders them
suitable for upholstery work, and the flesh splits are dressed in
considerable quantity for &ldquo;japanned&rdquo; (&ldquo;patent&rdquo;) leather and
&ldquo;bolsters,&rdquo; which are used to grain other skins on, the raised
buff affording a grip on the skin being grained and thus preventing
slipping. When the skins arrive in the tanyard (generally
lightly salted) they are drummed in old drench liquors until soft,
dipped into warm water and &ldquo;blubbered&rdquo; with a sharp knife;
they are then alternately dipped in warm water and drummed
several times to remove fat, after which they are heavily limed,
as they are still very greasy, and after unhairing and fleshing they
are heavily puered for the same reason. The tannage takes about
a month, and is much the same as for other leathers, the skins
being split when &ldquo;struck through.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Alligator leather is now produced to some extent both in the
United States and India. The belly and flanks alone are useful.
There are no special tanneries or processes for dressing the skins.
Layers are not given. The leather is used mostly for small fancy
goods, and is much imitated on sheepskin by embossing.</p>

<p>Snake and frog skins are also dressed to some extent, the latter
having formed a considerable item in the exports of Japan; they
are dressed mostly for cigar cases and pocket books. The general
procedure is first to lime the goods and then to remove any scales
(in the case of snake skins) by scraping with an unhairing knife on
a small beam, after which the skins are bated and tanned in sumach
by paddling.</p>

<p>A considerable amount of leather is now produced in Australia
from the skins of kangaroo, wallaby and other marsupials. These
skins are both tanned and &ldquo;tawed,&rdquo; the principal tanning agents
being mimosa bark, mallet bark and sugar bush, which abound in
Australia. The leather produced is of excellent quality, strong and
pliable, and rivals in texture and appearance the kid of Europe;
but the circumstance that the animals exist only in the wild state
renders them a limited and insecure source of leather.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>341</span></p>

<p><i>Japan and Enamel Leathers.</i>&mdash;Japanning is usually done on
flesh splits, whereas enamelling is done on the grain, and if
splits are used they are printed and boarded. The leather
should be mellow, soft, free from grease, with a firm grain
and no inclination to stretch. It is first shaved very smooth,
thoroughly scoured with a stone, sumached, washed, slicked
out tight and dried; when &ldquo;sammied,&rdquo; the grain is buffed to
remove scratches and oiled, the goods are then whitened or fluffed,
and if too hard, bruised by boarding; enamel goods are now
grained. The skins are now tightly nailed on boards and any holes
patched up with brown paper, so that the japan shall not touch
the flesh when the first thick coat of japan or the &ldquo;daub&rdquo; is
put on. This is applied so thickly that it cannot soak in, with
fine-toothed slicker, and then placed in a hot stove for twenty-four
hours until quite dry; the coating is then pumiced smooth
and the second thinner coat, termed &ldquo;blanback,&rdquo; is applied.
This is dried and pumiced, and a fine coating of japan or copal
varnish is finally given. This is dried and cooled, and if the
goods are for enamel they are boarded.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>English japans sometimes contain light petroleum, but no turps.
The secret of successful japanning lies in the age of the oil used;
the older the linseed oil is, the better the result. To prepare the
ground coat, boil 10 gallons linseed oil for one hour with 2 &#8468; litharge
at 600¬∞ F. to jellify the oil, and then add 2 &#8468; prussian blue and boil
the whole for half an hour longer. Before application the mixture is
thinned with 10 gallons light petroleum. For the second coat, boil
10 gallons linseed oil for 2 hours with 2 &#8468; prussian blue and 2 &#8468;
lampblack; when of a thin jelly consistency thin with 5 gallons of
benzine or light petroleum. For the finishing coat, boil 5 gallons of
linseed oil for 1 hour, then add 1 &#8468; prussian blue, and boil for
another hour; thin with 10 gallons petroleum and apply with a
brush in a warm room. After drying, the goods are mellowed by
exposure to the sun for at least three days.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Tawing.</i>&mdash;Wool rugs are, after the preliminary processes,
sometimes tanned in oak bark liquors by paddling, but are
generally &ldquo;tawed,&rdquo; that is, dressed with alum and salt, and are
therefore more suitably dealt with under that head. Tawing
implies that the conversion of skins into leather is carried out
by means of a mixture of which the more important constituents
are mineral salts, such as alum, chrome and iron, which may or
may not be supplemented with fatty and albuminous matter,
both animal and vegetable.</p>

<p>As an example of alum tawing, calf kid may be taken as
characteristic of the process; glove kid is also treated on similar
lines. The goods are prepared for tawing in a manner similar
to the preparation of tanned leathers, arsenical limes being used
to ensure a fine grain. After being well drenched and washed
the goods are ready for the tawing process. On the continent
of Europe it is usual for the goods to be thrown into a tub with
the tawing paste and trodden with the bare feet, although this old-fashioned
method is gradually being driven out, and the drum
or tumbler is being used.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The tawing paste consists of a mixture of alum, salt, flour, egg
yolk and water; the quantities of each constituent diverge widely,
every dresser having his own recipe. The following has been used,
but cannot well be classed as typical: For 100 &#8468; skin take 9 &#8468;
alum, 5 &#8468; salt, dissolve in water, and mix to a thin paste with
from 5 to 13 &#8468; flour, using 4 to 6 egg yolks for every pound of flour
used. Olive oil is also mixed in sometimes. The skins are drummed
or trodden, at intervals, in the warm paste for some hours, removed,
allowed to drain, and dried rapidly, damped down or &ldquo;sammied&rdquo;
and &ldquo;staked&rdquo; by drawing them to and fro over a blunt knife fixed
in the top of a post, and known as a knee stake; this process softens
them very considerably. After staking, the goods are wet back and
shaved smooth, either with a moon knife, <i>i.e.</i> a circular concave
convex knife, the centre of which has been cut out, a piece of wood
bridging the cavity forming the grip, or with an ordinary currier&rsquo;s
shaving knife; the skins are now ready for dyeing and finishing.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Wool Rug Dressing.</i>&mdash;Wool rugs are first thoroughly soaked,
well washed and clean-fleshed, scoured well by rubbing into the
wool a solution of soft soap and soda, and then leathered by
rubbing into the flesh of the wet skins a mixture consisting of
three parts of alum and two parts of salt until they are practically
dry; they are now piled up over-night, and the mixture is again
applied. After the second or third application the goods should
be quite leathered. Other methods consist of stretching the
skins in frames and painting the flesh with a solution of alum
and salt, or, better, with a solution of basic alum and salt, the
alum being made basic by the gradual addition of soda until
a permanent precipitate is produced.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The goods are now bleached, for even the most vigorous scouring
will not remove the yellow tint of the wool, especially at the tips.
There are several methods of bleaching, viz. by hydrogen peroxide,
following up with a weak vitriol bath; by potassium permanganate,
following up with a bath of sulphurous acid; or by fumigating in
an air-tight chamber with burning sulphur. The last-named method
is the more general; the wet skins are hung in the chamber, an iron
pot containing burning sulphur is introduced, and the exposure is
continued for several hours.</p>

<p>If the goods are to be finished white, they are now given a vitriol
sour, scoured, washed, retanned, dried, and when dry softened by
working with a moon knife. If they are to be dyed, they must be
prepared for the dye solution by &ldquo;chloring,&rdquo; which consists of
immersion in a cold solution of bleaching powder for some hours,
and then souring in vitriol.</p>

<p>The next step is dyeing. If basic dyes are to be used, it is necessary
to neutralize the acidity of the skins by careful addition of
soda, and to prevent the tips from being dyed a darker colour than
the roots. Glauber salts and acetic acid are added to the dye-bath.
The tendency of basic colours to rub off may be overcome by passing
the goods through a solution of tannin in the form of cutch, sumach,
quebracho, &amp;c.; in fact, some of the darker-coloured materials
may be used as a ground colour, thus economizing dyestuff and
serving two purposes. If acid colours are used, it is necessary to
add sulphuric acid to the dye bath, and in either case colours which
will strike below 50¬∞ C. must be used, as at that temperature alum
leather perishes.</p>

<p>After being dyed, the goods are washed up, drained, and if necessary
retanned, the glossing finish is then produced by passing them
through a weak emulsion or &ldquo;fat liquor&rdquo; of oil, soap and water,
after which they are dried, softened by working with a moon knife
and beating, when they are combed out, and are ready for the
market.</p>

<p>Blacks are dyed by immersing the goods alternately in solutions
of logwood and iron, or a one-solution method is used, consisting of
a mixture of these two, with, in either case, varying additions of
lactic acid and sumach, copper salts, potassium bichromate, &amp;c.;
the time of immersion varies from hours to days. After striking,
the goods are exposed to the air for some hours in order to oxidize
to a good black; they are then well scoured, washed, drained,
retanned, dried, softened and combed.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Chrome Tanning.</i>&mdash;The first chrome tanning process was
described by Professor Knapp in 1858 in a paper on &ldquo;Die Natur
und Wesen der Gerberie,&rdquo; but was first brought into commercial
prominence by Dr Heinzerling about 1878, and was worked
in a most persevering way by the Eglinton Chemical Company,
who owned the English patents, though all their efforts failed
to produce any lasting effects. Now chrome tanning is almost
the most important method of light leather dressing, and has
also taken a prominent place in the heavy department, more
especially in curried leathers and cases where greater tensile
strength is needed. The leather produced is much stronger
than any other leather, and will also stand boiling water, whereas
vegetable-tanned leather is completely destroyed at 70¬∞ C. and
alum leather at 50¬∞ C.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The theory of chrome tanning is not perfectly understood, but in
general terms it consists of a partial chemical combination between
the hide fibre and the chrome salts, and a partial mechanical deposition
of chromium oxide in and on the fibre. The wet work, or
preparation for tanning, may be taken as much the same as for
any other leather.</p>

<p>There are two distinct methods of chrome tanning, and several
different methods of making the solutions. The &ldquo;two bath process&rdquo;
consists of treating the skins with a bichromate in which the
chromium is in the acidic state, and afterwards reducing it to the
basic state by some reducing agent. The exact process is as
follows: To prevent wrinkled or &ldquo;drawn&rdquo; grain the goods are
first paddled for half an hour in a solution of vitriol and salt, when
they are piled or &ldquo;horsed&rdquo; up over night, and then, without washing,
placed in a solution consisting of 7 &#8468; of potassium bichromate,
3¬Ω &#8468; of hydrochloric acid to each 100 &#8468; of pelts, with sufficient
water to conveniently paddle in; it is recommended that 5% of
salt be added to this mixture. The goods are run in this for about
3 hours, or until struck through, when they are horsed up for some
hours, care being taken to cover them up, and are then ready for
the reducing bath. This consists of a 14% solution of plain &ldquo;hypo,&rdquo;
or hyposulphite of soda, to which, during the process of reduction,
frequent additions of hydrochloric acid are made to free the sulphurous
and thiosulphuric acids, which are the active reducing
agents. After about 3 hours&rsquo; immersion, during which time the
goods will have changed in colour from bright yellow to bright
green, one or two skins are cut in the thickest part, and if the green
has struck right through, the pack is removed as tanned, washed up,
and allowed to drain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>342</span></p>

<p>The &ldquo;single-bath process&rdquo; consists of paddling, drumming, or
otherwise introducing into the skins a solution of a chrome salt,
usually chrome alum, which is already in the basic condition, and
therefore does not require reducing. The basic solutions are made
as follows: For 100 &#8468; of pelts 9 &#8468; of chrome alum are dissolved
in 9 gallons of water, and 2¬Ω &#8468; of washing soda already dissolved in
1 gallon of water are gradually added, with constant stirring. One-third
of the solution is added to 80 gallons of water, to which is
added 7 &#8468; of salt, and the skins are introduced; the other two-thirds
are introduced at intervals in two successive portions. Another
liquor, used in the same way, is made by dissolving 3 &#8468; of potassium
bichromate in hot water, adding ¬Ω gallon strong hydrochloric acid
and then, gradually, about 1¬Ω &#8468; of glucose or grape sugar; this
reduces the acidic chrome salt, vigorous effervescence ensuing. The
whole is made up to 2 gallons and 5% to 15% of salt is added.
In yet another method a chrome alum solution is rendered basic
by boiling with &ldquo;hypo,&rdquo; and after the reaction has ceased the
solution is allowed to settle and the clear portion used.</p>

<p>After tanning, which takes from 8 hours to as many, and even
more, days, depending upon the method used and the class of skin
being dressed, the skins tanned by both methods are treated in a
similar manner, and are neutralized by drumming in borax solution,
when they are washed free from borax by drumming in warm
water, and are ready for dyeing, a process which will be dealt with
further on. The goods are sometimes tanned by suspension, but this
method is generally reserved for the tanning of the heavier leathers,
which are treated in much the same way, the several processes taking
longer.</p>

<p><i>Iron Tannage.</i>&mdash;Before leaving mineral tanning, mention may be
made of iron tannage, although this has gained no prominent
position in commerce. Ferric salts possess powerful tanning properties,
and were thoroughly investigated by Professor Knapp,
who took out several patents, but the tendency to produce a brittle
leather has never been entirely overcome, although it has been
greatly modified by the incorporation of organic matter, such as
blood, rosin, paraffin, urine, &amp;c. Knapp&rsquo;s basic tanning liquor is
made as follows: A strong solution of ferrous sulphate is boiled
and then oxidized to the ferric state by the careful addition of
nitric acid. Next, to destroy excess of nitric acid, ferrous sulphate
is added until effervescence ceases and the resulting clear orange-coloured
solution is concentrated to a varnish-like consistency. It
does not crystallize or decompose on concentration. The hides or
skins are prepared for tanning in the usual way, and then handled
or otherwise worked in solutions of the above iron salt, the solutions,
which are at first weak, being gradually strengthened.</p>

<p>The tannage occupies from 2 to 8 days, and the goods are then
stuffed in a ventilated drum with greases or soap. If the latter is
used, an insoluble iron soap is precipitated on the fibres of the
leather, which may then be finally impregnated with stearin and
paraffin, and finished in the usual manner as described under Curried
Leathers. A very fair leather may also be manufactured by using
iron alum and salt in the same manner as described under ordinary
alum and salt.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Combination Tannages.</i>&mdash;Leathers tanned by mixtures or
separate baths of both mineral and vegetable tanning agents
have now taken an important position in commerce. Such
leathers are the Swedish and Danish glove leathers, the United
States &ldquo;dongola leather,&rdquo; and French glazed kid. The usefulness
of such a combination will be evident, for while vegetable
tanning produces fullness, plumpness and resistance to water,
the mineral dressing produces a softness unnatural to vegetable
tannages without the use of large quantities of oils and fats.
It may also be noted that once a leather has been thoroughly
tanned with either mineral or vegetable materials, although it
will absorb large quantities of the material which has not been
first used, it will retain in the main the characteristics of the
tannage first applied. The principle had long been used in the
manufacture of such tough and flexible leathers as &ldquo;green
leather,&rdquo; &ldquo;combing leather&rdquo; and &ldquo;picker bands,&rdquo; but was first
applied to the manufacture of imitation glazed kid by Kent in
America, who, about 1878, discovered the principle of &ldquo;fatliquoring,&rdquo;
and named his product &ldquo;dongola leather.&rdquo; The discovery
of this process revolutionized the manufacture of combination
leathers.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Swedish and Danish glove leathers were first given a dressing
of alum and salt, with or without the addition of flour and egg, and
were then finished and coloured with vegetable materials, generally
with willow bark, although, in cases of scarcity, sumach, oak bark,
madder and larch were resorted to. The &ldquo;green leathers&rdquo; manufactured
in England generally receive about a week&rsquo;s tannage in
gambier liquors, and are finished off in hot alum and salt liquors,
after which they are dried, have the crystallized salts slicked off,
are damped back, and heavily stuffed with moellon, degras or sod
oil. Kent, in the manufacture of his dongola leather, used mixed
liquors of gambier alum and salt, and when tanned, washed the
goods in warm water to remove excess of tanning agent, piled up to
samm, and fatliquored. In making alum combinations it must be
borne in mind that alum leather will not glaze, and if a glazed
finish is required, a fairly heavy vegetable tannage should be first
applied. For dull finishes the mineral tannage may advantageously
precede the vegetable.</p>

<p>Very excellent chrome combination leather is also manufactured
by the application of the above principles, gambier always being in
great favour as the vegetable agent. The use of other materials
deprives the leather of its stretch, although they may be advantageously
used where the latter property is objectionable.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Oil Tanning.</i>&mdash;Under the head of oil tanning is included
&ldquo;buff leather,&rdquo; &ldquo;buck leather,&rdquo; &ldquo;piano leather,&rdquo; &ldquo;chamois
leather,&rdquo; and to a greater or lesser extent, &ldquo;Preller&rsquo;s crown or
helvetia leather.&rdquo; The process of oil tanning dates back to
antiquity, and was known as &ldquo;shamoying,&rdquo; now spelt &ldquo;chamoising.&rdquo;
Chamoising yields an exceedingly tough, strong and durable
leather, and forms an important branch of the leather industry.
The theory of the process is the same as the theory of currying,
which is nothing more or less than chamoising, viz. the lubrication
of the fibres by the oil itself and the aldehyde tanning which
takes place, due to the oxidation and decomposition of the esters
of the fatty acids contained in the oil. The fact that an aldehyde
tannage takes place seems to have been first discovered by Payne
and Pullman, who took out a patent in 1898, covering formaldehyde
and other aldehydes used in alkaline solutions. Their
product, &ldquo;Kaspine&rdquo; leather, found considerable application
in the way of military accoutrements. Chamois, buff, buck and
piano leathers are all manufactured by the same process slightly
modified to suit the class of hide used, the last three being heavy
leathers, the first light.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As regards the process used for chamois leather, the reader will
remember, from the account of the vegetable tannage of sheep
skins, that after splitting from the limes, the fleshes were thrown
back into the pits for another three weeks&rsquo; liming (six weeks in all)
preparatory to being dressed as chamois leather. It is necessary to
lime the goods for oil dressing very thoroughly, and if the grain
has not been removed by splitting, as in the case of sheep skins,
it is &ldquo;frized&rdquo; off with a sharp knife over the beam. The goods are
now rinsed, scudded and drenched, dried out until stiff, and stocked
in the faller stocks with plenty of cod oil for 2 to 3 hours until they
show signs of heating, when they are hung up in a cool shed. This
process is repeated several times during a period of from 4 to 6 days,
the heat driving the water out of the skins and the oil replacing it.
At the end of this time the goods, which will have changed to a
brown colour, are hung up and allowed to become as dry as possible,
when they are hung in a warm stove for some hours, after which
they are piled to heat off, thrown into tepid water and put through
a wringing machine. The grease which is recovered from the
wringing machine is known commercially as &ldquo;degras&rdquo; or &ldquo;moellon,&rdquo;
and fetches a good price, as it is unrivalled for fatliquoring and
related processes, such as stuffing, producing a very soft product.
They next receive a warm soda lye bath, and are again wrung; this
removes more grease, which forms soap with the lye, and is recovered
by treatment with vitriol, which decomposes the soap.
The grease which floats on top of the liquor is sold under the name
of &ldquo;sod oil.&rdquo; This also is a valuable material for fatliquoring, &amp;c.,
but not so good as degras.</p>

<p>After being wrung out, the goods are bleached by one of the
processes mentioned in the section on wool rug dressing, the permanganate
method being in general use in England. In countries
where a fine climate prevails the soap bleach or &ldquo;sun bleach&rdquo; is
adopted; this consists of dipping the goods in soap solution and
exposing them to the sun&rsquo;s rays, the process being repeated three
or more times as necessary.</p>

<p>The next step is fatliquoring to induce softness, after which they
are dried out slowly, staked or &ldquo;perched&rdquo; with a moon knife,
fluffed on a revolving wheel covered with fine emery to produce the
fine &ldquo;nap&rdquo; or surface, brushed over with french chalk, fuller&rsquo;s earth
or china clay, and finally finished on a very fine emery wheel.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Preller&rsquo;s Helvetia or Crown Leather.</i>&mdash;This process of leather
manufacture was discovered in 1850 by Theodor Klemm, a
cabinetmaker of W√ºrttemberg, who being then in poor circumstances,
sold his patent to an Englishman named Preller,
who manufactured it in Southwark, and adopted a crown as
his trade mark. Hence the name &ldquo;crown&rdquo; leather. The
manufacture then spread through Switzerland and Germany,
the product being used in the main for picker straps, belting
and purposes where waterproof goods were required, such as
hose pipes and military water bags. No taste is imparted to
the water by this leather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>343</span></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The process of manufacture is as follows: The hides are unhaired
by short liming, painting with lime and sulphide, or sweating, and
cleansed by scudding and washing, after which they are coloured
in bark liquors, washed up through clean water, and hung up to
dry partially. When in a sammied condition the goods are placed
on a table and a thick layer of the tanning paste spread on the
flesh side. The tanning paste varies with each manufacturer, but
the following is the mixture originally used by Preller: 100 parts
flour, 100 parts soft fat or horse tallow, 35 parts butter, 88 parts
ox brains, 50 parts milk, 15 parts salt or saltpetre.</p>

<p>The hides are now rolled in bundles, placed in a warm drum and
worked for 8 to 10 hours, after which they are removed and hung
up until half dry, when the process is repeated. Thus they are
tumbled 3 to 4 times, set out flesh and grain, rinsed through tepid
water, set out, sammied, and curried by coating with glycerin, oil,
tallow and degras. The table grease is now slicked off, and the
goods are set out in grease, grained and dried.</p>

<p><i>Transparent Leather.</i>&mdash;Transparent leather is a rather horny
product, somewhat like raw hide, and has been used for stitching
belts and picker bands. The goods to be dressed are limed, unhaired,
very thoroughly delimed with acids, washed in water, scudded
and clean-fleshed right to the veins; they are now stretched in
frames, clean-fleshed with a moon knife, and brushed with warm
water, when several coats of glycerin, to which has been added
some antiseptic such as salicylic or picric acid, are applied; the
goods are then dried out, and another coat is applied, and when
semi-dry they are drummed in a mixture of glycerin, boracic acid,
alum and salt, with the addition of a little bichromate of potash to
stain them a yellow colour. After drumming for 2 to 3 hours
they are removed, washed up, lightly set out, and stretched in
frames to dry, when they are ready for cutting into convenient
lengths for use.</p>

<p><i>Parchment.</i>&mdash;A certain class of sheep skin known as Hampshires
is generally used in the manufacture of this speciality. The skins
as received are first very carefully washed to remove all dirt, dewooled,
limed for 3 to 4 weeks, they are then cleanly fleshed, unhaired,
rinsed up in water, and thickly split, the poorer hides being
<span class="correction" title="amended from ultilized">utilized</span> for chamois; they are now re-split at the fatty strata so
that all fat may be easily removed, and while the grains are dressed
as skivers, the fleshes are tied in frames, watered with hot water,
scraped and coated on both sides with a cream consisting of whiting,
soda and water, after which they are dried out in a hot stove. In
the drying the whiting mixture absorbs the grease from the skins;
in fact, this method of degreasing is often employed in the manufacture
of wool rugs. When dry, both sides of the skins are flooded to
remove the whiting, and are then well rubbed over with a flat piece
of pumice-stone, swilled, dried, re-pumiced, again swilled, and
when sammied are rolled off with a wooden roller and dried out.</p>

<p><i>Tar and Peat Tanning.</i>&mdash;Tar tanning was discovered by a French
chemist named Philippi, who started with the idea that, if coal was
a decomposition product of forests, it must still necessarily possess
the tanning properties originally present in the trees. However
far-fetched such an argument may seem, Philippi succeeded in producing
a leather from wood and coal tar at a fairly cheap rate, the
product being of excellent texture and strength, but rather below
the average in the finish, which was inclined to be patchy, showing
oily spots. His method consisted of impregnating the goods with
refined tar and some organic acid, but the product does not seem to
have taken any hold upon the market, and is not much heard of now.</p>

<p>Peat tanning was discovered by Payne, an English chemist, who
was also the co-discoverer of the Payne-Pullman formaldehyde tanning
process. His peat or humic acid tannage was patented by him
about 1905, and is now worked on a commercial scale. The humic
acid is first extracted from the peat by means of alkalis, and the
hides are treated with this solution, the humic acid being afterwards
precipitated in the hides by treatment with some stronger
organic or mineral acid.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Dyeing, Staining and Finishing.</i>&mdash;These operations are
practised almost exclusively on the lighter leathers. Heavy
leathers, except coloured and black harness and split hides for
bag work, are not often dyed, and their finishing is generally
considered to be part of the tannage. In light leathers a great
business is done in buying up &ldquo;crust&rdquo; stock, <i>i.e.</i> rough tanned
stock, and then dyeing and finishing to suit the needs and
demands of the various markets. The carrying out of these
operations is a distinct and separate business from tanning,
although where possible the two businesses are carried on in the
same works.</p>

<p>Whatever the goods are and whatever their ultimate finish,
the first operation, upon receipt by the dyer of the crust stock,
is sorting, an operation requiring much skill. The sorter must
be familiar with the why and wherefore of all subsequent processes
through which the leather must go, so as to judge of the suitability
of the various qualities of leather for these processes, and to
know where any flaws that may exist will be sufficiently suppressed
or hidden to produce a saleable product, or will be rendered
entirely unnoticeable. The points to be considered in the sorting
are coarseness or fineness of texture, boldness or fineness of grain,
colour, flaws including stains and scratches, substance, &amp;c.
Light-coloured and flawless goods are parcelled out for fine and
delicate shades, those of darker hue and few flaws are parcelled
out for the darker shades, such as maroons, greens (sage and
olive), dark blues, &amp;c., and those which are so badly stained as to
be unsuitable for colours go for blacks. After sorting, the goods
are soaked back to a limp condition by immersion in warm
water, and are then horsed up to drip, having been given, perhaps,
a preliminary slicking out.</p>

<p>Up to this point all goods are treated alike, but the subsequent
processes now diverge according to the class of leather being
treated and the finish required.</p>

<p>Persian goods for glac√©s, moroccos, &amp;c., require special preparation
for dyeing, being first re-tanned. As received, they are
sorted and soaked as above, piled to samm, and shaved. Shaving
consists of rendering the flesh side of the skins smooth by shaving
off irregularities, the skin, which is supported on a rubber roller
actuated by a foot lever, being pressed against a series of spiral
blades set on a steel roller, which is caused to revolve rapidly.
When shaved, the goods are stripped, washed up, soured,
sweetened and re-tanned in sumach, washed up, and slicked out,
and are then ready for dyeing.</p>

<p>There are three distinct methods of dyeing, with several minor
modifications. Tray dyeing consists of immersing the goods,
from 2 to 4 dozen at a time, in two separate piles, in the dye
solution at 60¬∞ C, contained in a flat wooden tray about
5 ft. √ó 4 ft. √ó 1 ft., and keeping them constantly moving by
continually turning them from one pile to the other. The
disadvantages of this method are that the bath rapidly cools,
thus dyeing rapidly at the beginning and slowly at the termination
of the operation; hence a large excess of dye is wasted, much
labour is required, and the shades obtained are not so level as
those obtained by the other methods. But the goods are under
observation the whole time, a very distinct advantage when
matching shades, and a white flesh may be preserved. The
paddle method of dyeing consists of paddling the goods in a large
volume of liquor contained in a semi-circular wooden paddle
for from half to three-quarters of an hour. The disadvantages
are that the liquor cools fairly rapidly, more dye is wasted than
in the tray method, and a white flesh cannot be preserved.
But larger packs can be dyed at the one operation, the goods are
under observation the whole time, and little labour is required.</p>

<p>The drum method of dyeing is perhaps best, a drum somewhat
similar to that used by curriers being preferable. The goods
are placed on the shelves inside the dry drum, the lid of which
is then fastened on, and the machinery is started; when the
drum is revolving at full speed, which should be about 12 to
15 revolutions per minute, the dye solution is added through
the hollow axle, and the dyeing continued for half an hour,
when, without stopping the drum, if desired, the goods may be
fatliquored by running in the fatliquor through the hollow axle.
The disadvantages are that the flesh is dyed and the goods cannot
be seen. The advantages are that little labour is required, a
large pack of skins may be treated, level shades are produced,
heat is retained, almost complete exhaustion of the dye-bath
is effected, and subsequent processes, such as fatliquoring,
may be carried out without stopping the drum.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Of the great number of coal-tar dyes on the market comparatively
few can be used in leather manufacture. The four chief classes are:
(1) acid dyes; (2) basic or tannin dyes; (3) direct or cotton dyes;
(4) mordant (alizarine) dyes.</p>

<p>Acid dyes are not so termed because they have acid characteristics;
the name simply denotes that for the development of the full shade
of colour it is necessary to add acid to the dye-bath. These dyes
are generally sodium salts of sulphonic acids, and need the addition
of an acid to free the dye, which is the sulphonic acid. Although
theoretically any acid (stronger than the sulphonic acid present)
will do for this purpose, it is found in practice that only sulphuric
and formic acids may be employed, because others, such as acetic,
lactic, &amp;c., do not develop the full shade of colour. Acid sodium
sulphate may also be successfully used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span></p>

<p>Acid colours produce a full level shade without bronzing, and do
not accentuate any defects in the leather, such as bad grain, &amp;c.
They are also moderately fast to light and rubbing. They are
generally applied to leather at a temperature between 50¬∞ and 60¬∞ C.,
with an equal weight of sulphuric acid. The quantity of dye used
varies, but generally, for goat, persians, &amp;c., from 25 to 30 oz. are
used per ten dozen skins, and for calf half as much again, dissolved
in such an amount of water as is most convenient according to the
method being used. If sodium bisulphate is substituted for sulphuric
acid twice as much must be used, and if formic acid three times as
much (by weight).</p>

<p>Basic dyes are salts of organic colour bases with hydrochloric or
some other suitable acid. Basic colours precipitate the tannins, and
thus, because of their affinity for them, dye very rapidly, tending to
produce uneven shades, especially if the tannin on the skin is unevenly
distributed. They are much more intense in colour than
the acid dyes, have a strong tendency to bronze, and accentuate
weak and defective grain. They are also precipitated by hard
waters, so that the hardness should be first neutralized by the
addition of acetic acid, else the precipitated colour lake may produce
streakily dyed leather. To prevent rapid dyeing, acetic acid or
sodium bisulphate should always be added in small quantity to the
dye-bath, preferably the latter, as it prevents bronzing. The most
important point about the application of basic dyes to leather is
the previous fixation of the tannin on the surface of the leather to
prevent its bleeding into the dye-bath and precipitating the dye.
All soluble salts of the heavy metals will fix the tannin, but few
are applicable, as they form colour lakes, which are generally undesirable.
Antimony and titanium salts are generally used, the
forms being tartar emetic (antimony potassium tartrate), antimonine
(antimony lactate), potassium titanium oxalate, and titanium
lactate. The titanium salts are economically used when dyeing
browns, as they produce a yellowish-brown shade; it is therefore
not necessary to use so much dye. About 2 oz. of tartar emetic and
8 oz. of salt is a convenient quantity for 1 dozen goat skins. The
bath is used at 30¬∞ to 40¬∞ C., and the goods are immersed for about
15 minutes, having been thoroughly washed before being dyed.
Iron salts are sometimes used by leather-stainers for saddening
(dulling) the shade of colour produced, iron tannate, a black salt,
being formed. It is often found economical to &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; goods
with acid, direct, or other colours, and then finish with basic colours;
this procedure forms a colour lake, and colour lakes are always faster
to light and rubbing than the colours themselves.</p>

<p>Direct cotton dyes produce shades of great delicacy, and are
used for the dyeing of pale and &ldquo;art&rdquo; shades. They are applied
in neutral or very slightly acid baths, formic and acetic acids being
most suitable with the addition of a quantity of sodium chloride or
sulphate. After dyeing, the goods are well washed to free from
excess of salt. The eosine colours, including erythrosine, phloxine,
rose Bengal, &amp;c., are applied in a similar manner, and are specially
used for the beautiful fluorescent pink shades they produce; acid
and basic colours and mineral acids precipitate them.</p>

<p>The mordant colours, which include the alizarine and anthracene
colours, are extremely fast to light, and require a mordant to develop
the colour. They are specially applicable to chamois leather, although
a few may be used for chrome and alum leathers, and one
or two are successfully applied to vegetable-tanned leather without
a mordant.</p>

<p>Sulphur or sulphide colours, the first of which to appear were
the famous Vidal colours, are applied in sodium sulphide solution,
and are most successfully used on chrome leather, as they produce
a colour lake with chrome salts, the resulting colour being very fast
to light and rubbing. A very serious disadvantage in connexion
with them is that they must necessarily be applied in alkaline
solution, and the alkali has a disintegrating effect upon the fibre
of the leather, which cannot be satisfactorily overcome, although
formaldehyde and glycerin mixtures have been patented for the
purpose.</p>

<p>The Janus colours are perhaps worth mentioning as possessing
both acid and basic characteristics; they precipitate tannin, and
are best regarded as basic dyes from a leather-dyer&rsquo;s standpoint.</p>
</div>

<p>The goods after dyeing are washed up, slicked out on an
inclined glass table, nailed on boards, or hung up by the hind
shanks to dry out.</p>

<p>Coal-tar dyes are not much used for the production of blacks,
as they do not give such a satisfactory result as logwood with
an iron mordant. In the dyeing of blacks the preliminary
operation of souring is always omitted and that of sumaching
sometimes, but if much tan has been removed it will be found
necessary to use sumach, although cutch may be advantageously
and cheaply substituted. After shaving, the goods, if to be
dressed for &ldquo;blue backs&rdquo; (blue-coloured flesh), are dyed as
already described, with methyl violet or some other suitable
dye; they are then folded down the back and drawn through
a hot solution of logwood and fustic extracts, and then rapidly
through a weak, cold iron sulphate and copper acetate solution.
Immediately afterwards they are rinsed up and either drummed
in a little neatsfoot oil or oiled over with a pad, flesh and grain,
and dried. When dry the goods are damped back and staked,
dried out and re-staked.</p>

<p>After dry-staking, the goods are &ldquo;seasoned,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> some suitable
mixture is applied to the grain to enable it to take the glaze.
The following is typical: 3 quarts logwood liquor, ¬Ω pint
bullock&rsquo;s blood, ¬Ω pint milk, ¬Ω gill ammonia, ¬Ω gill orchil
and 3 quarts water. This season is brushed well into the grain,
and the goods are dried in a warm stove and glazed by machine.
The skins are glazed under considerable pressure, a polished
glass slab or roller being forced over the surface of the leather
in a series of rapid strokes, after which the goods are re-seasoned,
re-staked, fluffed, re-glazed, oiled over with a pad, dipped in
linseed oil and dried. They are now ready for market. If the
goods are to be finished dull they are seasoned with linseed
mucilage, casein or milk (many other materials are also used),
and rolled, glassed with a polished slab by hand, or ironed with
a warm iron.</p>

<p>Coloured glac√©s are finished in a similar manner to black
glac√©s, dye (instead of logwood and iron) being added to the
season, which usually consists of a simple mixture of dye,
albumen and milk.</p>

<p>Moroccos and grain leathers are boarded on the flesh side before
and after glazing, often being &ldquo;tooth rolled&rdquo; between the
several operations. Tooth rolling consists of forcing, under
pressure, a toothed roller over the grain; this cuts into the leather
and helps to produce many grains, which could not be produced
naturally by boarding, besides fixing them.</p>

<p>Many artificial grains and patterns are also given to leather
by printing and embossing, these processes being carried out by
passing the leather between two rollers, the top one upon which
the pattern is engraved being generally steam heated. This
impresses the pattern upon the grain of the leather.</p>

<p>The above methods will give a very general idea of the processes
in vogue for the dressing of goods for fancy work. The dressing
of chrome leathers for uppers is different in important particulars.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Chrome Box and Willow Calf.</i>&mdash;Willow calf is coloured calf, box
calf is dressed black and grained with a &ldquo;box&rdquo; grain. A large
quantity of kips is now dressed as box calf; these goods are the
hides of yearling Indian cattle, and are dressed in an exactly similar
manner as calf. After tanning and boraxing to neutralize the
acidity of the chrome liquor, the goods are washed up, sammied,
shaved, and are ready for mordanting previous to dyeing. Very
few dyes will dye chrome leather direct, <i>i.e.</i> without mordanting.
Sulphide colours are not yet in great demand, nor are the alizarines
used as much as they might be. The ordinary acid and basic dyes
are more generally employed, and the goods consequently require
to be first mordanted. The mordanting is carried out by drumming
the goods in a solution containing tannin, and, except for pale
shades, some dyewood extract is used; for reds peachwood extract,
for browns fustic or gambier, and for dark browns a little logwood
is added. For all pale shades sumach is exclusively used. After
drumming in the warm tannin infusion for half an hour, if the goods
are to be dyed with basic colours the tannin is first fixed by drumming
in tartar emetic and salt, or titanium, as previously described; the
dyeing is also carried out as described for persians, except that a
slightly higher temperature may be maintained. If the goods are
to be dyed black they are passed through logwood and iron solutions.</p>

<p>After dyeing and washing up, &amp;c., the goods are fatliquored by
placing them in a previously heated drum and drumming them
with a mixture known as a &ldquo;fatliquor,&rdquo; of which the following
recipe is typical: Dissolve 3 &#8468; of soft soap by boiling with 3
gallons of water, then add 9 &#8468; of neatsfoot oil and boil for some
minutes; now place the mixture in an emulsifier and emulsify
until cooled to 35¬∞ C., then add the yolks of 5 fresh eggs and emulsify
for a further half hour. The fatliquor is added to the drum at 55¬∞ C.,
and the goods are drummed for half an hour, when all the fatliquor
should be absorbed; they are then slicked out and dried. After
drying, they are damped back, staked, dried, re-staked and seasoned
with materials similar to those used for persians; when dry they
are glazed, boarded on the flesh (&ldquo;grained&rdquo;) from neck to butt
and belly to belly to give them the box grain, fluffed, reseasoned,
reglazed and regrained.</p>

<p><i>Finishing of Bag Hides.</i>&mdash;The goods are first soaked back, piled
to samm, split or shaved, scoured by machine, finished off by hand,
washed up and retanned by drumming in warm sumach and extract,
after which they are washed up, struck out, hung up to
samm, and &ldquo;set.&rdquo; &ldquo;Setting&rdquo; consists of laying the grain flat and
smooth by striking out with a steel or sharp brass slicker. They
are then dried out, topped with linseed mucilage, and again dried.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>345</span>
This brushing over with linseed mucilage prevents the dye from
sinking too far into the leather; gelatine, Irish moss, starch and
gums are also used for the same purpose. These materials are also
added to the staining solution to thicken it and further prevent its
sinking in.</p>

<p>When dry, the goods are stained by applying a ¬Ω% (usually)
solution of a suitable basic dye, thickened with linseed, with a brush.
Two men are usually employed on this work; one starts at the
right-hand flank and the other at the left-hand shank, and they
work towards each other, staining in sections; much skill is needed
to obviate markings where the sections overlap. The goods may
advantageously be bottomed with an acid dye or a dye-wood extract,
and then finished with basic dyes. Whichever method is used,
two to three coats are given, drying between each. After the last
coat of stain, and while the goods are still in a sammied condition,
a mixture of linseed mucilage and French chalk is applied to the
flesh and glassed off wet, to give it a white appearance, and then
the goods are printed with any of the usual bag grains by machine
or hand, and dried out. For a bright finish the season may consist
of a solution of 15 parts carnauba wax, 10 parts curd soap and
100 parts water boiled together; this is sponged into the grain,
dried and the hides are finished by either glassing or brushing. For
a duller finish the grain is simply rubbed over with buck tallow
and brushed. Hide bellies for small work are treated in much the
same manner.</p>

<p><i>Glove Leathers.</i>&mdash;As these goods were tanned in alum, salt, flour
and egg, any undue immersion in water removes the tannage; for
this reason they are generally stained like bag hides, one man only
being employed on the same skin. The skins are first thoroughly
soaked in warm water and then drummed for some minutes in a
fresh supply, when they are re-egged to replace that which has been
lost. This is best done by drumming them for about 1¬Ω hours in
40 to 50 egg yolks and 5 &#8468; of salt for every hundred skins; they
are then allowed to be in pile for 24 hours, and are set out on the
table ready for mordanting. The mordants universally used are
ammonia or alkaline soft soap; 1 in 1000 of the former or a 1%
solution of the latter. When the goods have partially dried in,
bottoming follows, and usually the natural wood dyestuffs are used
for this operation, such as fustic, Brazil wood, peachwood, logwood
and turmeric. After application of these colours the goods are
sammied and topped with a 1% solution of an acid dye, to which
has been added 20% of methylated spirit to prevent frothing with
the egg yolk; they are then dried out slowly, staked, pulled in
shape, fluffed and brushed by machine. The season, which is
sponged on, may consist of 1 part dye, 1 part albumen, 2 parts
dextrine and ¬º part glycerine, made up to 100 parts with water;
when it has been applied, the goods are sammied, brushed and
ironed with a warm flat iron such as is used in laundry work.</p>

<p><i>Bookbinding Leathers.</i>&mdash;A committee of the Society of Arts
(London) has investigated the question of leather for bookbinding,
attention having been drawn to this subject by the rotten and
decayed condition often observed in bindings less than fifty years
old. This committee engaged in research work extending over
several years, and the report in which its results were given was
edited for the Society of Arts and the Leathersellers&rsquo; Company
(which also did much important work in connexion with it) by Lord
Cobham, chairman of the committee, and Sir Henry Trueman
Wood, secretary of the society. The essence of the report, so far as
leather manufacture is concerned, is as follows: The goods should
be soaked and limed in fresh liquors, and bating and puering should
be avoided, weak organic acids or erodine being used; they should
also be tanned with pyrogallol tanning materials, and preferably
with sumach. In shaving, they should only be necked and backed,
<i>i.e.</i> only irregularities should be removed, as further shaving has a
considerable weakening effect on the fibre. The striking out should
not be heavy enough to lay the fibre. In dyeing, acid dyes and a
few direct colours only are permissible, and in connexion with the
former the use of sulphuric acid is strongly condemned, as it absolutely
disintegrates the fibre; the use of formic, acetic and lactic
acids is permitted. The use of salts of mineral acids is to be avoided,
and in finishing, tight setting out and damp glazing is not to be
recommended; oil may be advantageously used.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEATHER, ARTIFICIAL.<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> Under the name of artificial
leather, or of American leather cloth, large quantities of a
material having, more or less, a leather-like surface are used,
principally for upholstery purposes, such as the covering of
chairs, lining the tops of writing desks and tables, &amp;c. There
is considerable diversity in the preparation of such materials.
A common variety consists of a web of calico coated with boiled
linseed oil mixed with dryers and lampblack or other pigment.
Several coats of this mixture are uniformly spread, smoothed
and compressed on the cotton surface by passing it between
metal rollers, and when the surface is required to possess a
glossy enamel-like appearance, it receives a finishing coat of
copal varnish. A grained morocco surface is given to the material
by passing it between suitably embossed rollers. Preparations
of this kind have a close affinity to cloth waterproofed with
indiarubber, and to such manufactures as ordinary waxcloth.
An artificial leather which has been patented and proposed
for use as soles for boots, &amp;c., is composed of powdered scraps
and cuttings of leather mixed with solution of guttapercha dried
and compressed. In place of the guttapercha solution, oxidized
linseed oil or dissolved resin may be used as the binding medium
for the leather powder.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEAVEN<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> (in Mid. Eng. <i>levain</i>, adapted from Fr. <i>levain</i>, in
same sense, from Lat. <i>levamen</i>, which is only found in the sense
of alleviation, comfort, <i>levare</i>, to lift up), a substance which
produces fermentation, particularly in the making of bread,
properly a portion of already fermented dough added to other
dough for this purpose (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bread</a></span>). The word is used figuratively
of any element, influence or agency which effects a subtle
or secret change. These figurative usages are mainly due to
the comparison of the kingdom of Heaven to leaven in Matt. xiii.
33, and to the warning against the leaven of the Pharisees in
Matt. xvi. 6. In the first example the word is used of a good
influence, but the more usual significance is that of an evil agency.
There was among the Hebrews an association of the idea of
fermentation and corruption, which may have been one source
of the prohibition of the use of leavened bread in sacrificial
offerings. For the usage of unleavened bread at the feasts of the
Passover and of Mass√¥th, and the connexion of the two, see

Pop. (1900) 20,738, of whom 3402 were foreign-born and 2925
were negroes; (1910 census) 19,363. It is one of the most
important railway centres west of the Missouri river, being
served by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa F√©, the Chicago, Burlington
&amp; Quincy, the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific, the
Chicago Great Western, the Missouri Pacific, the Union Pacific
and the Leavenworth &amp; Topeka railways. The city is laid out
regularly in the bottom-lands of the river, and its streets are
named after Indian tribes. Rolling hills surround it on three
sides. The city has many handsome public buildings, and contains
the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, Leavenworth being
the see of a Roman Catholic bishop. The public institutions
include the Kansas State Protective Home (1889) for negroes,
an Old Ladies&rsquo; Rest (1892), St Vincent&rsquo;s Orphans&rsquo; Asylum (1886,
open to all sects) and a Guardian Angels&rsquo; Home (1889), for
negroes&mdash;all private charities aided by the state; also St John&rsquo;s
Hospital (1879), Cushing Hospital (1893) and Leavenworth
Hospital (1900), which are training schools for nurses. There
is also a branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer
Soldiers. In the suburbs there are state and United States
penitentiaries. Leavenworth is a trading centre and has various
manufactures, the most important being foundry and machine
shop and flouring and grist-mill products, and furniture. The
city&rsquo;s factory products increased in value from $3,251,460 in
1900 to $4,151,767 in 1905, or 27.7%. There are valuable coal

Leavenworth, an important United States military post,
associated with which are a National Cemetery and Service
Schools of the U.S. Army (founded in 1881 as the U.S. Infantry
and Cavalry School and in 1901 developed into a General Service
and Staff College). In 1907 there were three general divisions
of these schools: the Army School of the Line, for officers (not
below the grade of captain) of the regular army and for militia
officers recommended by the governors of their respective states
or territories, offering courses in military art, engineering, law
and languages; the Army Signal School, also open to regular
and militia officers, and having departments of field signalling,
signal engineering, topography and languages; and the Army
Staff College, in which the students are the highest graduates
from the Army School of the Line, and the courses of instruction
are included in the departments of military art, engineering, law,
languages and care of troops. The course is one year in each
school. At Fort Leavenworth there is a colossal bronze statue
of General U. S. Grant erected in 1889. A military prison was
established at Fort Leavenworth in 1875; it was used as a civil
prison from 1895 to 1906, when it was re-established as a military
prison. Its inmates were formerly taught various trades, but
owing to the opposition of labour organizations this system was
discontinued, and the prisoners are now employed in work on
the military reservation.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The fort, from which the city took its name, was built in 1827,
in the Indian country, by Colonel Henry Leavenworth (1783-1834)
of the 3rd Infantry, for the protection of traders plying between
the Missouri river and <span class="correction" title="amended from Sante">Santa</span> F√©. The town site was claimed by
Missourians from Weston in June 1854, Leavenworth thus being
the oldest permanent settlement in Kansas; and during the contest
in Kansas between the anti-slavery and pro-slavery settlers, it was
known as a pro-slavery town. It was first incorporated by the
Territorial legislature in 1855; a new charter was obtained in 1881;
and in 1908 the city adopted the commission plan of government.
On the 3rd of April 1858 a free-state convention adopted the Leavenworth
Constitution here; this constitution, which was as radically
anti-slavery as the Lecompton Constitution was pro-slavery, was
nominally approved by popular vote in May 1858, and was later
submitted to Congress, but never came into effect. During the Civil
War Leavenworth enjoyed great prosperity, at the expense of
more inland towns, partly owing to the proximity of the fort, which
gave it immunity from border raids from Missouri and was an
important dep√¥t of supplies and a place for mustering troops into
and out of the service. Leavenworth was, in Territorial days and
until after 1880, the largest and most thriving commercial city of
the state, and rivalled Kansas City, Missouri, which, however, finally
got the better of it in the struggle for railway facilities.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEBANON<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span> (from Semitic <i>laban</i>, &ldquo;to be white,&rdquo; or &ldquo;whitish,&rdquo;
probably referring not to snow, but to the bare white walls of
chalk or limestone which form the characteristic feature of the
whole range), in its widest sense is the central mountain mass of
Syria, extending for about 100 m. from N.N.E. to S.S.W. It is
bounded W. by the sea, N. by the plain Jun Akkar, beyond
which rise the mountains of the Ansarieh, and E. by the inland
plateau of Syria, mainly steppe-land. To the south Lebanon
ends about the point where the river Litany bends westward,
and at Banias. A valley narrowing towards its southern end,
and now called the Buka&rsquo;a, divides the mountainous mass into
two great parts. That lying to the west is still called Jebel
Libnan; the greater part of the eastern mass now bears the name
of the Eastern Mountain (Jebel el-Shar&#7731;i). In Greek the western
range was called Libanos, the eastern Antilibanos. The southern
extension of the latter, Mount Hermon (<i>q.v.</i>), may in many respects
be treated as a separate mountain.</p>

<p>Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon have many features in common;
in both the southern portion is less arid and barren than the
northern, the western valleys better wooded and more fertile
than the eastern. In general the main elevations of the two
ranges form pairs lying opposite one another; the forms of both
ranges are monotonous, but the colouring is splendid, especially
when viewed from a distance; when seen close at hand only a
few valleys with perennial streams offer pictures of landscape
beauty, their rich green contrasting pleasantly with the bare
brown and yellow mountain sides. The finest scenery is found
in N. Lebanon, in the Maronite districts of Kesrawan and
Bsherreh, where the gorges are veritable canyons, and the villages
are often very picturesquely situated. The south of the chain
is more open and undulating. Anti-Lebanon is the barest and
most inhospitable part of the system.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The district west of Lebanon, averaging about 20 m. in breadth,
slopes in an intricate series of plateaus and terraces to the Mediterranean.
The coast is for the most part abrupt and rocky, often
leaving room for only a narrow path along the shore, and when
viewed from the sea it does not suggest the extent of country lying
between its cliffs and the lofty summits behind. Most of the mountain
spurs run from east to west, but in northern Lebanon the prevailing
direction of the valleys is north-westerly, and in the south
some ridges run parallel with the principal chain. The valleys have
for the most part been deeply excavated by mountain streams;
the apparently inaccessible heights are crowned by numerous villages,
castles or cloisters embosomed among trees. The chief perennial
streams, beginning from the north, are the Nahr Akkar, N. Arka,
N. el-Barid, N. Kadisha, &ldquo;the holy river&rdquo; (the valley of which
begins in the immediate neighbourhood of the highest summits,
and rapidly descends in a series of great bends till the river reaches
the sea at Tripoli), Wadi el-Joz (falling into the sea at Batrun),
Wadi Fidar, Nahr Ibrahim (the ancient Adonis, having its source
in a recess of the great mountain amphitheatre where the famous
sanctuary Apheca, the modern Afka, lay), Nahr el-Kelb (the ancient
Lycus), Nahr Beirut (the ancient Magoras, entering the sea at
Beirut), Nahr Damur (ancient Tamyras), Nahr el-&rsquo;Auwali (the ancient
Bostrenus, which in the upper part of its course is joined by the
Nahr el-Baruk). The &lsquo;Auwali and the Nahr el-Zaherani, the only
other considerable streams before we reach the Litany, flow north-east
to south-west, in consequence of the interposition of a ridge
subordinate and parallel to the central chain. On the north, where the
mountain bears the special name of Jebel Akkar, the main ridge
of Lebanon rises gradually from the plain. A number of valleys run
to the north and north-east, among them that of the Nahr el-Kebir,
the Eleutherus of the ancients, which rises in the Jebel el-Abiad on
the eastern slope of Lebanon, and afterwards, skirting the district,
flows westward to the sea. South of Jebel el-Abia&#7693;, beneath the
main ridge, which as a rule falls away suddenly towards the east,
occur several small elevated terraces having a southward slope;
among these are the Wadi en-Nusur (&ldquo;vale of eagles&rdquo;), and the basin
of the lake Yammuna, with its intermittent spring Neb&rsquo;a el-Arba&rsquo;in.
Of the streams which descend into the Buka&rsquo;a, the Berdani rises in
Jebel Sunnin, and enters the plain by a deep and picturesque mountain
cleft at Za&#7717;leh.</p>

<p>The most elevated summits occur in the north, but even these
are of very gentle gradient. The &ldquo;Cedar block&rdquo; consists of a double
line of four and three summits respectively, ranged from north to
south, with a deviation of about 35¬∞. Those to the east are &lsquo;Uyun
Urghush, Makmal, Muskiyya (or Naba&rsquo; esh-Shemaila) and Ras
Zahr el-Kazib; fronting the sea are Kam Sauda or Timarun,
Fumm el-Mizab and Zahr el-Kandil. The height of Zahr el-Kazib,
by barometric measurement, is 10,018 ft.; that of the others does
not reach 10,000 ft. South from them is the pass (8351 ft.) which
leads from Baalbek to Tripoli; the great mountain amphitheatre
on the west side of its summit is remarkable. Farther south is a
second group of lofty summits&mdash;the snow-capped Sunnin, visible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>347</span>
from Beirut; its height is 8482 ft. Between this group and the
more southerly Jebel Keniseh (about 6700 ft.) lies the pass (4700 ft.)
traversed by the French post road between Beirut and Damascus.
Among the bare summits still farther south are the long ridge of
Jebel el-Baruk (about 7000 ft.), the Jebel Niha, with the Tau&rsquo;amat
Niha (about 6100 ft.), near which is a pass to Sidon, and the Jebel
Rihan (about 5400 ft.).</p>

<p>The Buka&rsquo;a, the broad valley which separates Lebanon from
Anti-Lebanon, is watered by two rivers having their watershed near
Baalbek, at an elevation of about 3600 ft., and separated only by
a short mile at their sources. That flowing northwards, El-&rsquo;Asi, is
the ancient Orontes (<i>q.v.</i>); the other is the Litany. In the lower part
of its course the latter has scooped out a deep and narrow rocky
bed; at Burghuz it is spanned by a great natural bridge. Not far
from the point where it suddenly trends to the west lie, immediately
above the romantic valley, at an elevation of 1500 ft., the imposing
ruins of the old castle Kal&rsquo;at esh-Shakif, near one of the passes to
Sidon. In its lower part the Litany bears the name of Nahr el-Kasimiya.
Neither the Orontes nor the Litany has any important
affluent.</p>

<p>The Buka&rsquo;a used to be known as Coelesyria (Strabo. xvi. 2, 21);
but that word as employed by the ancients had a much more extensive
application. At present its full name is Buka&rsquo;a el-&rsquo;Aziz
(the dear Buka&rsquo;a), and its northern portion is known as Sahlet
Ba&rsquo;albek (the plain of Baalbek). The valley is from 4 to 6 m.
broad, with an undulating surface.</p>

<p>The Anti-Lebanon chain has been less fully explored than that
of Lebanon. Apart from its southern offshoots it is 67 m. long,
while its width varies from 16 to 13¬Ω m. It rises from the plain of
Hasya-Homs, and in its northern portion is very arid. The range
has not so many offshoots as occur on the west side of Lebanon;
under its precipitous slopes stretch table-lands and broad plateaus,
which, especially on the east side looking towards the steppe,
steadily increase in width. Along the western side of northern
Anti-Lebanon stretches the Khasha&rsquo;a, a rough red region lined with
juniper trees, a succession of the hardest limestone crests and ridges,
bristling with bare rock and crag that shelter tufts of vegetation,
and are divided by a succession of grassy ravines. On the eastern
side the parallel valley of &lsquo;Asal el-Ward deserves special mention;
the descent towards the plain eastwards, as seen for example at
Ma&rsquo;lula, is singular&mdash;first a spacious amphitheatre and then two
deep very narrow gorges. Few perennial streams take their rise in
Anti-Lebanon; one of the finest and best watered valleys is that of
Helbun, the ancient Chalybon, the Helbon of Ezek. xxvii. 18. The
highest points of the range, reckoning from the north, are Halimat
el-Kabu (8257 ft.), which has a splendid view; the Fatli block,
including Tal&rsquo;at Musa (8721 ft.) and the adjoining Jebel Nebi Baruh
(7900 ft.); and a third group near Bludan, in which the most prominent
names are Shakif, Akhyar and Abu&lsquo;l-Hin (8330 ft.); Of
the valleys descending westward the first to claim mention is the
Wadi Yafufa; a little farther south, lying north and south, is the
rich upland valley of Zebedani, where the Barada has its highest
sources. Pursuing an easterly course, this stream receives the
waters of the romantic &lsquo;Ain Fije (which doubles its volume), and
bursts out by a rocky gateway upon the plain of Damascus, in the
irrigation of which it is the chief agent. It is the Abana of 2 Kings
v. 12; the portion of Anti-Lebanon traversed by it was also called
by the same name (Canticles iv. 8). From the point where the
southerly continuation of Anti-Lebanon begins to take a more
westerly direction, a low ridge shoots out towards the south-west,
trending farther and farther away from the eastern chain and
narrowing the Buka&rsquo;a; upon the eastern side of this ridge lies the
elevated valley or hilly stretch known as Wadi et-Teim. In the
north, beside &lsquo;Ain Faluj, it is connected by a low watershed with
the Buka&rsquo;a; from the gorge of the Litany it is separated by the
ridge of Jebel e&#7693;-&#7692;ahr. At its southern end it contracts and merges
into the plain of Ba&#7751;ias, thus enclosing Mount Hermon on its
north-west and west sides; eastward from the Hasbany branch of
the Jordan lies the meadow-land Merj &lsquo;Iyun, the ancient Ijon
(1 Kings xv. 20).</p>

<p><i>Vegetation.</i>&mdash;The western slope of Lebanon has the common
characteristics of the flora of the Mediterranean coast, but the
Anti-Lebanon belongs to the poorer region of the steppes, and the
Mediterranean species are met with only sporadically along the
water-courses. Forest and pasture land do not properly exist:
the place of the first is for the most part taken by a low brushwood;
grass is not plentiful, and the higher ridges maintain alpine plants
only so long as patches of snow continue to lie. The rock walls
harbour some rock plants, but many absolutely barren wildernesses
of stone occur. (1) On the western slope, to a height of 1600 ft.,
is the coast region, similar to that of Syria in general and of the
south of Asia Minor. Characteristic trees are the locust tree and
the stone pine; in <i>Melia Azedarach</i> and <i>Ficus Sycomorus</i> (Beirut)
is an admixture of foreign and partially subtropical elements. The
great mass of the vegetation, however is of the low-growing type
(<i>maquis</i> or <i>garrigue</i> of the western Mediterranean), with small and
stiff leaves, and frequently thorny and aromatic, as for example the
ilex (<i>Quercus coccifera</i>), <i>Smilax</i>, <i>Cistus</i>, <i>Lentiscus</i>, <i>Calycotome</i>, &amp;c.
(2) Next comes, from 1600 to 6500 ft., the mountain region, which
may also be called the forest region, still exhibiting sparse woods
and isolated trees wherever shelter, moisture and the inhabitants
have permitted their growth. From 1600 to 3200 ft. is a zone of
dwarf hard-leaved oaks, amongst which occur the Oriental forms
<i>Fontanesia phillyraeoides</i>, <i>Acer syriacum</i> and the beautiful red-stemmed
<i>Arbutus Andrachne</i>. Higher up, between 3700 and 4200 ft.,
a tall pine, <i>Pinus Brutia</i>, is characteristic. Between 4200 and 6200 ft.
is the region of the two most interesting forest trees of Lebanon, the
cypress and the cedar. The former still grows thickly, especially
in the valley of the Kadisha; the horizontal is the prevailing
variety. In the upper Kadisha valley there is a cedar grove of
about three hundred trees, amongst which five are of gigantic size.
(See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cedar</a></span>.) The cypress and cedar zone exhibits a variety
of other leaf-bearing and coniferous trees; of the first may be
mentioned several oaks&mdash;<i>Quercus subalpina</i> (Kotschy), <i>Q. Cerris</i>
and the hop-hornbeam (<i>Ostrya</i>); of the second class the rare Cilician
silver fir (<i>Abies cilicica</i>) may be noticed. Next come the junipers,
sometimes attaining the size of trees (<i>Juniperus excelsa</i>, <i>J. rufescens</i>
and, with fruit as large as plums, <i>J. drupacea</i>). But the chief ornament
of Lebanon is the <i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>, with its brilliant
purple flower clusters; a peculiar evergreen, <i>Vinca libanotica</i>, also
adds beauty to this zone. (3) Into the alpine region (6200 to
10,400 ft.) penetrate a few very stunted oaks (<i>Quercus subalpina</i>),
the junipers already mentioned and a barberry (<i>Berberis cretica</i>),
which sometimes spreads into close thickets. Then follow the low,
dense, prone, pillow-like dwarf bushes, thorny and grey, common
to the Oriental highlands&mdash;<i>Astragalus</i> and the peculiar <i>Acantholimon</i>.
They are found to within 300 ft. of the highest summits.</p>

<p>Upon the exposed mountain slopes a species of rhubarb (<i>Rheum
Ribes</i>) is noticeable, and also a vetch (<i>Vicia canescens</i>) excellent for
sheep. The spring vegetation, which lasts until July, appears to be
rich, especially as regards showy plants, such as <i>Corydalis</i>, <i>Gagea</i>,
<i>Colchicum</i>, <i>Puschkinia</i>, <i>Geranium</i>, <i>Ornithogalum</i>, &amp;c. The flora of
the highest ridges, along the edges of the snow patches, exhibits
no forms related to the northern alpine flora, but suggestions of it
are found in a <i>Draba</i>, an <i>Androsace</i>, an <i>Alsine</i> and a violet, occurring,
however, only in local species. Upon the highest summits are found
<i>Saponaria Pumilio</i> (resembling our <i>Silene acaulis</i>) and varieties
of <i>Galium</i>, <i>Euphorbia</i>, <i>Astragalus</i>, <i>Veronica</i>, <i>Jurinea</i>, <i>Festuca</i>,
<i>Scrophularia</i>, <i>Geranium</i>, <i>Asphodeline</i>, <i>Allium</i>, <i>Asperula</i>; and, on
the margins of the snow fields, a <i>Taraxacum</i> and <i>Ranunculus demissus</i>.
The alpine flora of Lebanon thus connects itself directly with the
Oriental flora of lower altitudes, and is unrelated to the glacial flora
of Europe and northern Asia.</p>

<p><i>Zoology.</i>&mdash;There is nothing of special interest about the fauna of
Lebanon. Bears are no longer numerous; the panther and the
ounce are met with; the wild hog, hyaena, wolf and fox are by
no means rare; jackals and gazelles are very common. The polecat
and hedgehog also occur. As a rule there are not many birds, but
the eagle and the vulture may occasionally be seen; of eatable
kinds partridges and wild pigeons are the most abundant.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;In the following sections the Lebanon proper
will alone be considered, without reference to Anti-Lebanon,
because the peculiar political status of the former range since
1864 has effectually differentiated it; whereas the Anti-Lebanon
still forms an integral part of the Ottoman province of Syria
(<i>q.v.</i>), and neither its population nor its history is readily distinguishable
from those of the surrounding districts.</p>

<p>The total population in the Lebanon proper is about 400,000,
and is increasing faster than the development of the province
will admit. There is consequently much emigration, the Christian
surplus going mainly to Egypt, and to America, the Druses to the
latter country and to the Hauran. The emigrants to America,
however, usually return after making money, build new houses
and settle down. The singularly complex population is composed
of Christians, Maronites, and Orthodox Eastern and
Uniate; of Moslems, both Sunni and Shiah (Metawali); and
of Druses.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Maronites</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) form about three-fifths of the whole and have
the north of the Mountain almost to themselves, while even in the
south, the old Druse stronghold, they are now numerous. Feudalism
is practically extinct among them and with the decline of the Druses,
and the great stake they have acquired in agriculture, they have
laid aside much of their warlike habit together with their arms.
Even their instinct of nationality is being sensibly impaired by
their gradual assimilation to the Papal Church, whose agents exercise
from Beirut an increasing influence on their ecclesiastical elections
and church government. They are strong also in the Buka&rsquo;a, and
have colonies in most of the Syrian cities.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Orthodox</i> Eastern form a little more than one-eighth of the
whole, and are strongest in S. Lebanon (Metn and Kurah districts).
Syrians by race and Arab-speaking, they are descendants of those
&ldquo;Melkites&rdquo; who took the side of the Byzantine church in the time
of Justinian II. against the Moslems and eventually the Maronites.
They are among the most progressive of the Lebanon elements.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Greek Uniate</i> are less numerous, forming little more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span>
one-twelfth, but are equally progressive. Their headquarters is
Zahleh; but they are found also in strength in Metn and Jezzin,
where they help to counterbalance Druses. They sympathize with
the Maronites against the Orthodox Eastern, and, like both, are of
Syrian race, and Arab speech.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Sunnite Moslems</i> are a weak element, strongest in Shuf and
Kurah, and composed largely of Druse renegades and &ldquo;Druse&rdquo;
families, which, like the Shehab, were of Arab extraction and never
conformed to the creed of Hamza.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Shiite Moslems</i> outnumber the Sunni, and make about one
twenty-fifth of the whole. They are called <i>Metawali</i> and are strongest
in North Lebanon (Kesrawan and Batrun), but found also in the
south, in Buka&rsquo;a and in the coast-towns from Beirut to Acre. They
are said to be descendants of Persian tribes; but the fact is very
doubtful, and they may be at least as aboriginal as the Maronites,
and a remnant of an old Incarnationist population which did not
accept Christianity, and kept its heretical Islam free from those
influences which modified Druse creed. They own a chief sheikh,
resident at Jeba&rsquo;a, and have the reputation, like most heretical
communities in the Sunni part of the Moslem world, of being exceedingly
fanatical and inhospitable. It is undoubtedly the case
that they are suspicious of strangers and defiant of interference.
Another small body of Shiites, the <i>Ismailites</i> (Assassins (<i>q.v.</i>) of the
crusading chronicles), also said to be of Persian origin, live about
Kadmus at the extreme N. of Lebanon, but outside the limits of
the privileged province. They are about 9000 strong.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>Druses</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), now barely an eighth of the whole and confined
to Shuf and Metn in S. Lebanon, are tending to emigrate or conform
to Sunni Islam. Since the establishment of the privileged province
they have lost the Ottoman support which used to compensate for
their numerical inferiority as compared with the Christians; and
they are fast losing also their old habits and distinctiveness. No
longer armed or wearing their former singular dress, the remnant of
them in Lebanon seems likely ere long to be assimilated to the
&ldquo;Osmanli&rdquo; Moslems. Their feud with the Maronites, whose
accentuation in the middle of the 19th century was largely due to
the tergiversations of the ruling Shehab family, now reduced to low
estate, is dying away, but they retain something of their old clan
feeling and feudal organization, especially in Shuf.</p>
</div>

<p>The mixed population, as a whole, displays the usual characteristics
of mountaineers, fine physique and vigorous independent
spirit; but its ancient truculence has given way before strong
government action since the middle 19th century, and the
great increase of agricultural pursuits, to which the purely
pastoral are now quite secondary. The culture of the mulberry
and silk, of tobacco, of the olive and vine, of many kinds of
fruits and cereals, has expanded enormously, and the Lebanon
is now probably the most productive region in Asiatic Turkey
in proportion to its area. It exports largely through Beirut
and Saida, using both the French railway which crosses S.
Lebanon on its way to Damascus, and the excellent roads and
mule-paths made since 1883. Lebanon has thick deposits of
lignite coal, but of inferior quality owing to the presence of
iron pyrites. The abundant iron is little worked. Manufactures
are of small account, the raw material going mostly to the
coast; but olive-oil is made, together with various wines, of which
the most famous is the <i>vino d&rsquo;oro</i>, a sweet liqueur-like beverage.
This wine is not exported in any quantity, as it will not bear
a voyage well and is not made to keep. Bee-keeping is general,
and there is an export of eggs to Egypt.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The inhabitants of Lebanon have at no time played
a conspicuous part in history. There are remains of prehistoric
occupation, but we do not even know what races dwelt there
in the historical period of antiquity. Probably they belonged
chiefly to the Aramaean group of nationalities; the Bible mentions
Hivites (Judges iii. 3) and Giblites (Joshua xiii. 5). Lebanon
was included within the ideal boundaries of the land of Israel,
and the whole region was well known to the Hebrews, by whose
poets its many excellences are often praised. How far the
Phoenicians had any effective control over it is unknown; the
absence of their monuments does not argue much real jurisdiction.
Nor apparently did the Greek Seleucid kingdom have much
to do with the Mountain. In the Roman period the district
of <i>Phoenice</i> extended to Lebanon. In the 2nd century, with
the inland districts, it constituted a subdivision of the province
of Syria, having Emesa (Homs) for its capital. From the time
of Diocletian there was a <i>Phoenice ad Libanum</i>, with Emesa
as capital, as well as a <i>Phoenice Maritima</i> of which Tyre was
the chief city. Remains of the Roman period occur throughout
Lebanon. By the 6th century it was evidently virtually
independent again; its Christianization had begun with the
immigration of Monothelite sectaries, flying from persecution
in the Antioch district and Orontes valley. At all times Lebanon
has been a place of refuge for unpopular creeds. Large part
of the mountaineers took up Monothelism and initiated the
national distinction of the Maronites, which begins to emerge
in the history of the 7th century. The sectaries, after helping
Justinian II. against the caliph Abdalmalik, turned on the
emperor and his Orthodox allies, and were named Mardaites
(rebels). Islam now began to penetrate S. Lebanon, chiefly
by the immigration of various more or less heretical elements,
Kurd, Turkoman, Persian and especially Arab, the latter
largely after the break-up of the kingdom of Hira; and early
in the 11th century these coalesced into a nationality (see
Druses) under the congenial influence of the Incarnationist
creed brought from Cairo by Ismael Darazi and other emissaries
of the caliph Hakim and his vizier Hamza. The subsequent
history of Lebanon to the middle of the 19th century will be
found under Druses and Maronites, and it need only be stated
here that Latin influence began to be felt in N. Lebanon during
the Frank period of Antioch and Palestine, the Maronites being
inclined to take the part of the crusading princes against the
Druses and Moslems; but they were still regarded as heretic
Monothelites by Abulfaragius (Bar-Hebraeus) at the end of the
13th century; nor is their effectual reconciliation to Rome
much older than 1736, the date of the mission sent by the pope
Clement XII., which fixed the actual status of their church.
An informal French protection had, however, been exercised
over them for some time previously, and with it began the feud
of Maronites and Druses, the latter incited and spasmodically
supported by Ottoman pashas. The feudal organization of
both, the one under the house of Khazin, the other under those
of Maan and Shehab successively, was in full force during the
17th and 18th centuries; and it was the break-up of this in the
first part of the 19th century which produced the anarchy that
culminated after 1840 in the civil war. The Druses renounced
their Shehab amirs when Beshir al-Kassim openly joined the
Maronites in 1841, and the Maronites definitely revolted from
the Khazin in 1858. The events of 1860 led to the formation
of the privileged Lebanon province, finally constituted in 1864.
It should be added, however, that among the Druses of Shuf,
feudalism has tended to re-establish itself, and the power is
now divided between the Jumblat and Yezbeki families, a leading
member of one of which is almost always Ottoman <i>kaimakam</i>
of the Druses, and locally called <i>amir</i>.</p>

<p>The Lebanon has now been constituted a <i>sanjak</i> or <i>mutessariflik</i>,
dependent directly on the Porte, which acts in this case in consultation
with the six great powers. This province extends about 93 m.
from N. to S. (from the boundary of the <i>sanjak</i> of Tripoli to that of
the <i>caza</i> of Saida), and has a mean breadth of about 28 m. from
one foot of the chain to the other, beginning at the edge of the
littoral plain behind Beirut and ending at the W. edge of the Buka&rsquo;a;
but the boundaries are ill-defined, especially on the E. where the
original line drawn along the crest of the ridge has not been adhered
to, and the mountaineers have encroached on the Buka&rsquo;a. The
Lebanon is under a military governor (<i>mushir</i>) who must be a Christian
in the service of the sultan, approved by the powers, and has,
so far, been chosen from the Roman Catholics owing to the great
preponderance of Latin Christians in the province. He resides at
Deir al-Kamar, an old seat of the Druse amirs. At first appointed
for three years, then for ten, his term has been fixed since 1892
at five years, the longer term having aroused the fear of the Porte,
lest a personal domination should become established. Under the
governor are seven <i>kaimakams</i>, all Christians except a Druse in
Shuf, and forty-seven <i>mudirs</i>, who all depend on the kaimakams
except one in the home district of Deir al-Kamar. A central <i>mejliss</i>
or Council of twelve members is composed of four Maronites, three
Druses, one Turk, two Greeks (Orthodox), one Greek Uniate and
one Metawali. This was the original proportion, and it has not
been altered in spite of the decline of the Druses and increase of
the Maronites. The members are elected by the seven cazas. In
each <i>mudirieh</i> there is also a local <i>mejliss</i>. The old feudal and
<i>mukataji</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Druses</a></span>) jurisdictions are abolished, <i>i.e.</i> they often
persist under Ottoman forms, and three courts of First Instance,
under the <i>mejliss</i>, and superior to the petty courts of the <i>mudirs</i>
and the village <i>sheikhs</i>, administer justice. Judges are appointed
by the governor, but sheikhs by the villages. Commercial cases, and
litigation in which strangers are concerned, are carried to Beirut.
The police is recruited locally, and no regular troops appear in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>349</span>
province except on special requisition. The taxes are collected
directly, and must meet the needs of the province, before any sum
is remitted to the Imperial Treasury. The latter has to make
deficits good. Ecclesiastical jurisdiction is exercised only over the
clergy, and all rights of asylum are abolished.</p>

<p>This constitution has worked well on the whole, the only serious
hitches having been due to the tendency of governors-general and
<i>kaimakams</i> to attempt to supersede the <i>mejliss</i> by autocratic action,
and to impair the freedom of elections. The attention of the porte
was called to these tendencies in 1892 and again in 1902, on the
appointments of new governors. Since the last date there has been
no complaint. Nothing now remains of the former French predominance
in the Lebanon, except a certain influence exerted by
the fact that the railway is French, and by the precedence in ecclesiastical
functions still accorded by the Maronites to official representatives
of France. In the Lebanon, as in N. Albania, the traditional
claim of France to protect Roman Catholics in the Ottoman
Empire has been greatly impaired by the non-religious character
of the Republic. Like Italy, she is now regarded by Eastern
Catholics with distrust as an enemy of the Holy Father.</p>

(1910) 1907. It is served by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio South-Western
railroad and by the East Saint Louis &amp; Suburban Electric line.
It is situated on a high tableland. Lebanon is the seat of
McKendree College, founded by Methodists in 1828 and one of
the oldest colleges in the Mississippi valley. It was called
Lebanon Seminary until 1830, when the present name was
adopted in honour of William McKendree (1757-1835), known
as the &ldquo;Father of Western Methodism,&rdquo; a great preacher, and
a bishop of the Methodist Church in 1808-1835, who had endowed
the college with 480 acres of land. In 1835 the college
was chartered as the &ldquo;McKendreean College,&rdquo; but in 1839 the
present name was again adopted. There are coal mines and
excellent farming lands in the vicinity of Lebanon. Among the
city&rsquo;s manufactures are flour, planing-mill products, malt
liquors, soda and farming implements. The municipality owns
and operates its electric-lighting plant. Lebanon was chartered
as a city in 1874.</p>

(magnetite) iron mines, from which about 18,000,000 tons of
iron ore were taken between 1740 and 1902, and 804,848 tons
in 1906. The ore yields about 46% of iron, and contains about
2.5% of sulphur, the roasting of the ores being necessary&mdash;ore-roasting
kilns are more extensively used here than in any
other place in the country. The area of ore exposed is about
4000 ft. long and 400 to 800 ft. wide, and includes three hills;
it has been one of the most productive magnetite deposits in
the world. Limestone, brownstone and brick-clay also abound
in the vicinity; and besides mines and quarries, the city has
extensive manufactories of iron, steel, chains, and nuts and bolts.
In 1905 its factory products were valued at $6,978,458. The
municipality owns and operates its water-works.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The first settlement in the locality was made about 1730, and
twenty years later a town was laid out by one of the landowners,

was born at Paris on the 15th of October 1701, and was educated
at the Coll√®ge de Sainte-Barbe and the Coll√®ge du Plessis; at
the latter he remained as a teacher until he obtained the chair
of rhetoric in the Coll√®ge des Grassins. In 1748 he was admitted
a member of the Academy of Inscriptions, and in 1752 he was
nominated professor of eloquence in the Coll√®ge de France.
From 1755 he held the office of perpetual secretary to the
Academy of Inscriptions, in which capacity he edited fifteen
volumes (from the 25th to the 39th inclusive) of the <i>Histoire</i>
of that institution. He died at Paris on the 13th of March 1778.</p>

of C. Rollin&rsquo;s <i>Histoire Romaine</i> and J. B. L. Crevier&rsquo;s <i>Histoire des
empereurs</i>. Its usefulness arises entirely from the fact of its being
a faithful r√©sum√© of the Byzantine historians, for Le Beau had no
originality or artistic power of his own. Five volumes were added
by H. P. Ameilhon (1781-1811), which brought the work down to

<p><span class="bold">LEBEAU, JOSEPH<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> (1794-1865), Belgian statesman, was born
at Huy on the 3rd of January 1794. He received his early
education from an uncle who was parish priest of Hannut, and
became a clerk. By dint of economy he raised money to study
law at Li√©ge, and was called to the bar in 1819. At Li√©ge he
formed a fast friendship with Charles Rogier and Paul Devaux,
in conjunction with whom he founded at Li√©ge in 1824 the
<i>Mathieu Laensbergh</i>, afterwards <i>Le politique</i>, a journal which
helped to unite the Catholic party with the Liberals in their
opposition to the ministry, without manifesting any open
disaffection to the Dutch government. Lebeau had not contemplated
the separation of Holland and Belgium, but his hand
was forced by the revolution. He was sent by his native district
to the National Congress, and became minister of foreign affairs
in March 1831 during the interim regency of Surlet de Chokier.
By proposing the election of Leopold of Saxe-Coburg as king
of the Belgians he secured a benevolent attitude on the part of
Great Britain, but the restoration to Holland of part of the duchies
of Limburg and Luxemburg provoked a heated opposition to
the treaty of London, and Lebeau was accused of treachery
to Belgian interests. He resigned the direction of foreign affairs
on the accession of King Leopold, but in the next year became
minister of justice. He was elected deputy for Brussels in 1833,
and retained his seat until 1848. Differences with the king led
to his retirement in 1834. He was subsequently governor of
the province of Namur (1838), ambassador to the Frankfort
diet (1839), and in 1840 he formed a short-lived Liberal ministry.
From this time he held no office of state, though he continued
his energetic support of liberal and anti-clerical measures. He
died at Huy on the 19th of March 1865.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEBEL, JEAN<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> (d. 1370), Belgian chronicler, was born near
the end of the 13th century. His father, Gilles le Beal des
Changes, was an alderman of Li√©ge. Jean entered the church
and became a canon of the cathedral church, but he and his
brother Henri followed Jean de Beaumont to England in 1327,
and took part in the border warfare against the Scots. His will
is dated 1369, and his epitaph gives the date of his death as 1370.
Nothing more is known of his life, but Jacques de Hemricourt,
author of the <i>Miroir des nobles de Hesbaye</i>, has left a eulogy of
his character, and a description of the magnificence of his attire,
his retinue and his hospitality. Hemricourt asserts that he was
eighty years old or more when he died. For a long time Jean
Lebel (or le Bel) was only known as a chronicler through a
reference by Froissart, who quotes him in the prologue of his
first book as one of his authorities. A fragment of his work,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>
in the MS. of Jean d&rsquo;Outremeuse&rsquo;s <i>Mireur des istores</i>, was discovered
in 1847; and the whole of his chronicle, preserved in
the library of Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, was edited in 1863 by L.
Polain. Jean Lebel gives as his reason for writing a desire to
replace a certain misleading rhymed chronicle of the wars of
Edward III. by a true relation of his enterprises down to the
beginning of the Hundred Years&rsquo; War. In the matter of style
Lebel has been placed by some critics on the level of Froissart.
His chief merit is his refusal to narrate events unless either he
himself or his informant had witnessed them. This scrupulousness
in the acceptance of evidence must be set against his limitations.
He takes on the whole a similar point of view to Froissart&rsquo;s;
he has no concern with national movements or politics; and,
writing for the public of chivalry, he preserves no general notion
of a campaign, which resolves itself in his narrative into a series
of exploits on the part of his heroes. Froissart was considerably
indebted to him, and seems to have borrowed from him some
of his best-known episodes, such as the death of Robert the Bruce,
Edward III. and the countess of Salisbury, and the devotion
of the burghers of Calais. The songs and virelais, in the art of
writing which he was, according to Hemricourt, an expert,
have not come to light.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEBER, JEAN MICHEL CONSTANT<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> (1780-1859), French
historian and bibliophile, was born at Orl√©ans on the 8th of
May 1780. His first work was a poem on Joan of Arc (1804);
but he wrote at the same time a <i>Grammaire g√©n√©ral synth√©tique</i>,
which attracted the attention of J. M. de G√©rando, then
secretary-general to the ministry of the interior. The latter
found him a minor post in his department, which left him leisure
for his historical work. He even took him to Italy when Napoleon
was trying to organize, after French models, the Roman states
which he had taken from the pope in 1809. Leber however did
not stay there long, for he considered the attacks on the temporal
property of the Holy See to be sacrilegious. On his return to
Paris he resumed his administrative work, literary recreations
and historical researches. While spending a part of his time
writing vaudevilles and comic operas, he began to collect old
essays and rare pamphlets by old French historians. His office
was preserved to him by the Restoration, and Leber put his
literary gifts at the service of the government. When the question
of the coronation of Louis XVIII. arose, he wrote, as an answer
to Volney, a minute treatise on the <i>C√©r√©monies du sacre</i>, which
was published at the time of the coronation of Charles X. Towards
the end of Vill√®le&rsquo;s ministry, when there was a movement
of public opinion in favour of extending municipal liberties,
he undertook the defence of the threatened system of centralization,
and composed, in answer to Raynouard, an <i>Histoire critique
du pouvoir municipal depuis l&rsquo;origine de la monarchie jusqu&rsquo;√†
nos jours</i> (1828). He also wrote a treatise entitled <i>De l&rsquo;√©tat
r√©el de la presse et des pamphlets depuis Fran√ßois I<span class="sp">er</span> jusqu&rsquo;√†
Louis XIV</i>., in which he refuted an empty paradox
of Charles Nodier, who had tried to prove that the press had
never been, and could never be, so free as under the Grand
Monarch. A few years later, Leber retired (1839), and sold to
the library of Rouen the rich collection of books which he had
amassed during thirty years of research. The catalogue he made
himself (4 vols., 1839 to 1852). In 1840 he read at the Acad√©mie
des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres two dissertations, an &ldquo;Essai
sur l&rsquo;appr√©ciation de la fortune priv√©e au moyen √¢ge,&rdquo; followed by
an &ldquo;Examen critique des tables de prix du marc d&rsquo;argent depuis
l&rsquo;√©poque de Saint Louis&rdquo;; these essays were included by the
Academy in its <i>Recueil de m√©moires pr√©sent√©s par divers savants</i>
(vol. i., 1844), and were also revised and published by Leber
(1847). They form his most considerable work, and assure him
a position of eminence in the economic history of France. He
also rendered good service to historians by the publication of
his <i>Collection des meilleures dissertations, notices et trait√©s relatifs
√† l&rsquo;histoire de France</i> (20 vols., 1826-1840); in the absence of
an index, since Leber did not give one, an analytical table of
contents is to be found in Alfred Franklin&rsquo;s <i>Sources de l&rsquo;histoire
de France</i> (1876, pp. 342 sqq.). In consequence of the revolution
of 1848, Leber decided to leave Paris. He retired to his native
town, and spent his last years in collecting old engravings.
He died at Orl√©ans on the 22nd of December 1859.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1832 he had been elected as a member of the <i>Soci√©t√© des Antiquaires

<p><span class="bold">LEBEUF, JEAN<a name="ar142" id="ar142"></a></span> (1687-1760), French historian, was born on
the 7th of March 1687 at Auxerre, where his father, a councillor
in the parlement, was <i>receveur des consignations</i>. He began his
studies in his native town, and continued them in Paris at
the Coll√®ge Ste Barbe. He soon became known as one of the
most cultivated minds of his time. He made himself master
of practically every branch of medieval learning, and had a
thorough knowledge of the sources and the bibliography of his
subject. His learning was not drawn from books only; he was
also an archaeologist, and frequently went on expeditions in
France, always on foot, in the course of which he examined the
monuments of architecture and sculpture, as well as the libraries,
and collected a number of notes and sketches. He was in
correspondence with all the most learned men of the day. His
correspondence with Pr√©sident Bouhier was published in 1885
by Ernest Petit; his other letters have been edited by the
<i>Soci√©t√© des sciences historiques et naturelles de l&rsquo;Yonne</i> (2 vols.,
1866-1867). He also wrote numerous articles, and, after his
election as a member of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres
(1740), a number of <i>M√©moires</i> which appeared in the
<i>Recueil</i> of this society. He died at Paris on the 10th of April
1760. His most important researches had Paris as their subject.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>He published first a collection of <i>Dissertations sur l&rsquo;histoire civile
et eccl√©siastique de Paris</i> (3 vols., 1739-1743), then an <i>Histoire de la
ville et de tout le dioc√®se de Paris</i> (15 vols., 1745-1760), which is a
mine of information, mostly taken from the original sources. In view
of the advance made by scholarship in the 19th century, it was
found necessary to publish a second edition. The work of reprinting
it was undertaken by H. Cocheris, but was interrupted (1863) before
the completion of vol. iv. Adrien Augier resumed the work, giving
Lebeuf&rsquo;s text, though correcting the numerous typographical errors
of the original edition (5 vols., 1883), and added a sixth volume containing
an analytical table of contents. Finally, Fernand Bournon
completed the work by a volume of <i>Rectifications et additions</i>
(1890), worthy to appear side by side with the original work.</p>

<p>The bibliography of Lebeuf&rsquo;s writings is, partly, in various numbers
of the <i>Biblioth√®que des √©crivains de Bourgogne</i> (1716-1741). His
biography is given by Lebeau in the <i>Histoire de l&rsquo;Acad√©mie royale des

<p><span class="bold">LE BLANC, NICOLAS<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> (1742-1806), French chemist, was
born at Issoudun, Indre, in 1742. He made medicine his profession
and in 1780 became surgeon to the duke of Orleans, but
he also paid much attention to chemistry. About 1787 he was
attracted to the urgent problem of manufacturing carbonate
of soda from ordinary sea-salt. The suggestion made in 1789
by Jean Claude de la M√©therie (1743-1817), the editor of the
<i>Journal de physique</i>, that this might be done by calcining with
charcoal the sulphate of soda formed from salt by the action of
oil of vitriol, did not succeed in practice because the product
was almost entirely sulphide of soda, but it gave Le Blanc, as
he himself acknowledged, a basis upon which to work. He soon
made the crucial discovery&mdash;which proved the foundation of the
huge industry of artificial alkali manufacture&mdash;that the desired
end was to be attained by adding a proportion of chalk to the
mixture of charcoal and sulphate of soda. Having had the
soundness of this method tested by Jean Darcet (1725-1801),
the professor of chemistry at the Coll√®ge de France, the duke of
Orleans in June 1791 agreed to furnish a sum of 200,000 francs for
the purpose of exploiting it. In the following September Le
Blanc was granted a patent for fifteen years, and shortly afterwards
a factory was started at Saint-Denis, near Paris. But it had not
long been in operation when the Revolution led to the confiscation
of the duke&rsquo;s property, including the factory, and about the same
time the Committee of Public Safety called upon all citizens
who possessed soda-factories to disclose their situation and
capacity and the nature of the methods employed. Le Blanc
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>351</span>
had no choice but to reveal the secrets of his process, and he had
the misfortune to see his factory dismantled and his stocks of
raw and finished materials sold. By way of compensation for
the loss of his rights, the works were handed back to him in 1800,
but all his efforts to obtain money enough to restore them and
resume manufacturing on a profitable scale were vain, and,
worn out with disappointment, he died by his own hand at
Saint-Denis on the 16th of January 1806.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Four years after his death, Michel Jean Jacques Diz√™ (1764-1852),
who had been <i>pr√©parateur</i> to Darcet at the time he examined the
process and who was subsequently associated with Le Blanc in its
exploitation, published in the <i>Journal de physique</i> a paper claiming
that it was he himself who had first suggested the addition of chalk;
but a committee of the French Academy, which reported fully on the
question in 1856, came to the conclusion that the merit was entirely
Le Blanc&rsquo;s (<i>Com. rend.</i>, 1856, p. 553).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEB&OElig;UF, EDMOND<a name="ar145" id="ar145"></a></span> (1809-1888), marshal of France, was
born at Paris on the 5th of November 1809, passed through the
√âcole Polytechnique and the school of Metz, and distinguished
himself as an artillery officer in Algerian warfare, becoming
colonel in 1852. He commanded the artillery of the 1st French
corps at the siege of Sebastopol, and was promoted in 1854 to
the rank of general of brigade, and in 1857 to that of general of
division. In the Italian War of 1859 he commanded the artillery,
and by his action at Solferino materially assisted in achieving
the victory. In September 1866, having in the meantime
become aide-de-camp to Napoleon III., he was despatched
to Venetia to hand over that province to Victor Emmanuel.
In 1869, on the death of Marshal Niel, General Leb&oelig;uf became
minister of war, and earned public approbation by his vigorous
reorganization of the War Office and the civil departments of the
service. In the spring of 1870 he received the marshal&rsquo;s baton.
On the declaration of war with Germany Marshal Leb&oelig;uf
delivered himself in the Corps L√©gislatif of the historic saying,
&ldquo;So ready are we, that if the war lasts two years, not a gaiter
button would be found wanting.&rdquo; It may be that he intended
this to mean that, given time, the reorganization of the War
Office would be perfected through experience, but the result
inevitably caused it to be regarded as a mere boast, though it
is now known that the administrative confusion on the frontier
in July 1870 was far less serious than was supposed at the time.
Leb&oelig;uf took part in the Lorraine campaign, at first as chief of
staff (major-general) of the Army of the Rhine, and afterwards,
when Bazaine became commander-in-chief, as chief of the III.
corps, which he led in the battles around Metz. He distinguished
himself, whenever engaged, by personal bravery and good
leadership. Shut up with Bazaine in Metz, on its fall he was
confined as a prisoner in Germany. On the conclusion of peace
he returned to France and gave evidence before the commission
of inquiry into the surrender of that stronghold, when he strongly
denounced Bazaine. After this he retired into private life to
the Ch√¢teau du Moncel near Argentan, where he died on the
7th of June 1888.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE BON, JOSEPH<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> (1765-1795), French politician, was born
at Arras on the 29th of September 1765. He became a priest in
the order of the Oratory, and professor of rhetoric at Beaune.
He adopted revolutionary ideas, and became a cur√© of the
Constitutional Church in the department of Pas-de-Calais,
where he was later elected as a <i>d√©put√© suppl√©ant</i> to the Convention.
He became <i>maire</i> of Arras and <i>administrateur</i> of Pas-de-Calais,
and on the 2nd of July 1793 took his seat in the Convention.
He was sent as a representative on missions into the departments
of the Somme and Pas-de-Calais, where he showed great severity
in dealing with offences against revolutionaries (8th Brumaire,
year II. to 22nd Messidor, year II.; <i>i.e.</i> 29th October 1793 to
10th July 1794). In consequence, during the reaction which
followed the 9th Thermidor (27th July 1794) he was arrested
on the 22nd Messidor, year III. (10th July 1795). He was tried
before the criminal tribunal of the Somme, condemned to death
for abuse of his power during his mission, and executed at
Amiens on the 24th Vend√©miaire in the year IV. (10th October
1795). Whatever Le Bon&rsquo;s offences, his condemnation was to a
great extent due to the violent attacks of one of his political
enemies, Armand Guffroy; and it is only just to remember that
it was owing to his courage that Cambrai was saved from falling
into the hands of the Austrians.</p>

province of Seville, near the left bank of the Guadalquivir,
and on the eastern edge of the marshes known as Las Marismas.
Pop. (1900) 10,997. Lebrija is 44 m. S. by W. of Seville, on the
Seville-Cadiz railway. Its chief buildings are a ruined Moorish
castle and the parish church, an imposing structure in a variety
of styles&mdash;Moorish, Gothic, Romanesque&mdash;dating from the 14th
century to the 16th, and containing some early specimens of the
carving of Alonso Cano (1601-1667). There are manufactures of
bricks, tiles and earthenware, for which clay is found in the
neighbourhood; and some trade in grain, wine and oil.</p>

<p>Lebrija is the <i>Nabrissa</i> or <i>Nebrissa</i>, surnamed <i>Veneria</i>, of the
Romans; by Silius Italicus (iii. 393), who connects it with the
worship of Dionysus, the name is derived from the Greek <span class="grk" title="nebris">&#957;&#949;&#946;&#961;&#943;&#962;</span>
(a &ldquo;fawn-skin,&rdquo; associated with Dionysiac ritual). <i>Nebrishah</i>
was a strong and populous place during the period of Moorish
domination (from 711); it was taken by St Ferdinand in 1249,
but again lost, and became finally subject to the Castilian crown
only under Alphonso the Wise in 1264. It was the birthplace
of Elio Antonio de Lebrija or Nebrija (1444-1522), better known
as Nebrissensis, one of the most important leaders in the revival
of learning in Spain, the tutor of Queen Isabella, and a collaborator
with Cardinal Jimenes in the preparation of the Complutensian
Polyglot (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alcala de Henares</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE BRUN, CHARLES<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span> (1619-1690), French painter, was born
at Paris on the 24th of February 1619, and attracted the notice
of Chancellor S√©guier, who placed him at the age of eleven in
the studio of Vouet. At fifteen he received commissions from
Cardinal Richelieu, in the execution of which he displayed an
ability which obtained the generous commendations of Poussin,
in whose company Le Brun started for Rome in 1642. In Rome
he remained four years in the receipt of a pension due to the
liberality of the chancellor. On his return to Paris Le Brun
found numerous patrons, of whom Superintendent Fouquet
was the most important. Employed at Vaux le Vicomte, Le
Brun ingratiated himself with Mazarin, then secretly pitting
Colbert against Fouquet. Colbert also promptly recognized
Le Brun&rsquo;s powers of organization, and attached him to his
interests. Together they founded the Academy of Painting and
Sculpture (1648), and the Academy of France at Rome (1666),
and gave a new development to the industrial arts. In 1660
they established the Gobelins, which at first was a great school
for the manufacture, not of tapestries only, but of every class
of furniture required in the royal palaces. Commanding the
industrial arts through the Gobelins&mdash;of which he was director&mdash;and
the whole artist world through the Academy&mdash;in which he
successively held every post&mdash;Le Brun imprinted his own
character on all that was produced in France during his lifetime,
and gave a direction to the national tendencies which endured
after his death. The nature of his emphatic and pompous
talent was in harmony with the taste of the king, who, full of
admiration at the decorations designed by Le Brun for his
triumphal entry into Paris (1660), commissioned him to execute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>352</span>
a series of subjects from the history of Alexander. The first
of these, &ldquo;Alexander and the Family of Darius,&rdquo; so delighted
Louis XIV. that he at once ennobled Le Brun (December, 1662),
who was also created first painter to his majesty with a pension
of 12,000 livres, the same amount as he had yearly received
in the service of the magnificent Fouquet. From this date all
that was done in the royal palaces was directed by Le Brun.
The works of the gallery of Apollo in the Louvre were interrupted
in 1677 when he accompanied the king to Flanders (on his return
from Lille he painted several compositions in the Ch√¢teau of
St Germains), and finally&mdash;for they remained unfinished at
his death&mdash;by the vast labours of Versailles, where he reserved
for himself the Halls of War and Peace, the Ambassadors&rsquo;
Staircase, and the Great Gallery, other artists being forced
to accept the position of his assistants. At the death of Colbert,
Louvois, who succeeded him in the department of public works,
showed no favour to Le Brun, and in spite of the king&rsquo;s continued
support he felt a bitter change in his position. This
contributed to the illness which on the 22nd of February 1690
ended in his death in the Gobelins. Besides his gigantic labours
at Versailles and the Louvre, the number of his works for religious
corporations and private patrons is enormous. He modelled
and engraved with much facility, and, in spite of the heaviness
and poverty of drawing and colour, his extraordinary activity
and the vigour of his conceptions justify his claim to fame.
Nearly all his compositions have been reproduced by celebrated
engravers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEBRUN, CHARLES FRAN√áOIS,<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> duc de Plaisance (1739-1824),
French statesman, was born at St-Sauveur-Lendelin
(Manche) on the 19th of March 1739, and in 1762 made his first
appearance as a lawyer at Paris. He filled the posts successively
of <i>censeur royale</i> (1766) and of inspector general of the domains
of the crown (1768); he was also one of the chief advisers of
the chancellor Maupeou, took part in his struggle against the
parlements, and shared in his downfall in 1774. He then devoted
himself to literature, translating Tasso&rsquo;s <i>Gerusalemme liberata</i>
(1774), and the <i>Iliad</i> (1776). At the outset of the Revolution
he foresaw its importance, and in the <i>Voix du citoyen</i>, which
he published in 1789, predicted the course which events would
take. In the Constituent Assembly, where he sat as deputy
for Dourdan, he professed liberal views, and was the proposer
of various financial laws. He then became president of the
directory of Seine-et-Oise, and in 1795 was elected as a deputy
to the Council of Ancients. After the <i>coup d&rsquo;√©tat</i> of the 18th
Brumaire in the year VIII. (9th November 1799), Lebrun was
made third consul. In this capacity he took an active part in
the reorganization of finance and of the administration of the
departments of France. In 1804 he was appointed arch-treasurer
of the empire, and in 1805-1806 as governor-general
of Liguria effected its annexation to France. He opposed
Napoleon&rsquo;s restoration of the noblesse, and in 1808 only reluctantly
accepted the title of duc de Plaisance (Piacenza).
He was next employed in organizing the departments which
were formed in Holland, of which he was governor-general from
1811 to 1813. Although to a certain extent opposed to the
despotism of the emperor, he was not in favour of his deposition,
though he accepted the <i>fait accompli</i> of the Restoration in April
1814. Louis XVIII. made him a peer of France; but during
the Hundred Days he accepted from Napoleon the post of
Grand Master of the university. On the return of the Bourbons
in 1815 he was consequently suspended from the House of Peers,
but was recalled in 1819. He died at St Mesmes (Seine-et-Oise)
on the 16th of June 1824. He had been made a member of
the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1803.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEBRUN, PIERRE ANTOINE<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> (1785-1873), French poet,
was born in Paris on the 29th of November 1785. An <i>Ode √† la
grande arm√©e</i>, mistaken at the time for the work of √âcouchard
Lebrun, attracted Napoleon&rsquo;s attention, and secured for the
author a pension of 1200 francs. Lebrun&rsquo;s plays, once famous,
are now forgotten. They are: <i>Ulysse</i> (1814), <i>Marie Stuart</i>
(1820), which obtained a great success, and <i>Le Cid d&rsquo;Andalousie</i>
(1825). Lebrun visited Greece in 1820, and on his return to
Paris he published in 1822 an ode on the death of Napoleon
which cost him his pension. In 1825 he was the guest of Sir
Walter Scott at Abbotsford. The coronation of Charles X. in
that year inspired the verses entitled <i>La Vall√©e de Champrosay</i>,
which have, perhaps, done more to secure his fame than his more
ambitious attempts. In 1828 appeared his most important poem,
<i>La Gr√®ce</i>, and in the same year he was elected to the Academy.
The revolution of 1830 opened up for him a public career; in
1831 he was made director of the Imprimerie Royale, and subsequently
filled with distinction other public offices, becoming
senator in 1853. He died on the 27th of May 1873.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEBRUN, PONCE DENIS √âCOUCHARD<a name="ar151" id="ar151"></a></span> (1729-1807), French
lyric poet, was born in Paris on the 11th of August 1729, in
the house of the prince de Conti, to whom his father was valet.
Young Lebrun had among his schoolfellows a son of Louis Racine
whose disciple he became. In 1755 he published an <i>Ode sur
les d√©sastres de Lisbon</i>. In 1759 he married Marie Anne de
Surcourt, addressed in his <i>√âl√©gies</i> as Fanny. To the early years
of his marriage belongs his poem <i>Nature</i>. His wife suffered
much from his violent temper, and when in 1774 she brought
an action against him to obtain a separation, she was supported
by Lebrun&rsquo;s own mother and sister. He had been <i>secr√©taire
des commandements</i> to the prince de Conti, and on his patron&rsquo;s
death was deprived of his occupation. He suffered a further
misfortune in the loss of his capital by the bankruptcy of the
prince de Gu√©men√©. To this period belongs a long poem, the
<i>Veill√©es des Muses</i>, which remained unfinished, and his ode
to Buffon, which ranks among his best works. Dependent on
government pensions he changed his politics with the times.
Calonne he compared to the great Sully, and Louis XVI. to
Henry IV., but the Terror nevertheless found in him its official
poet. He occupied rooms in the Louvre, and fulfilled his obligations
by shameless attacks on the unfortunate king and queen.
His excellent ode on the <i>Vengeur</i> and the <i>Ode nationale contre
Angleterre</i> on the occasion of the projected invasion of England
are in honour of the power of Napoleon. This &ldquo;versatility&rdquo;
has so much injured Lebrun&rsquo;s reputation that it is difficult
to appreciate his real merit. He had a genius for epigram,
and the quatrains and dizaines directed against his many
enemies have a verve generally lacking in his odes. The one
directed against La Harpe is called by Sainte-Beuve the &ldquo;queen
of epigrams.&rdquo; La Harpe has said that the poet, called by his
friends, perhaps with a spice of irony, Lebrun-Pindare, had
written many fine strophes but not one good ode. The critic
exposed mercilessly the obscurities and unlucky images which
occur even in the ode to Buffon, and advised the author to
imitate the simplicity and energy that adorned Buffon&rsquo;s prose.
Lebrun died in Paris on the 31st of August 1807.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His works were published by his friend P. L. Ginguen√© in 1811.
The best of them are included in Prosper Poitevin&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Petits po√®tes

<p><span class="bold">LE CARON, HENRI<a name="ar152" id="ar152"></a></span> (whose real name was <span class="sc">Thomas Miller
Beach</span>) (1841-1894), British secret service agent, was born at
Colchester, on the 26th of September 1841. He was of an
adventurous character, and when nineteen years old went to
Paris, where he found employment in business connected with
America. Infected with the excitement of the American Civil
War, he crossed the Atlantic in 1861 and enlisted in the Northern
army, taking the name of Henri Le Caron. In 1864 he married
a young lady who had helped him to escape from some Confederate
marauders; and by the end of the war he rose to be major.
In 1865, through a companion in arms named O&rsquo;Neill, he was
brought into contact with Fenianism, and having learnt of the
Fenian plot against Canada, he mentioned the designs when
writing home to his father. Mr Beach told his local M.P., who
in turn told the Home Secretary, and the latter asked Mr Beach
to arrange for further information. Le Caron, inspired (as all
the evidence shows) by genuinely patriotic feeling, from that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>353</span>
time till 1889 acted for the British government as a paid military
spy. He was a proficient in medicine, among other qualifications
for this post, and he remained for years on intimate terms
with the most extreme men in the Fenian organization under
all its forms. His services enabled the British government
to take measures which led to the fiasco of the Canadian invasion
of 1870 and Riel&rsquo;s surrender in 1871, and he supplied full details
concerning the various Irish-American associations, in which
he himself was a prominent member. He was in the secrets of
the &ldquo;new departure&rdquo; in 1879-1881, and in the latter year had
an interview with Parnell at the House of Commons, when the
Irish leader spoke sympathetically of an armed revolution in
Ireland. For twenty-five years he lived at Detroit and other
places in America, paying occasional visits to Europe, and all
the time carrying his life in his hand. The Parnell Commission
of 1889 put an end to this. Le Caron was subpoenaed by <i>The
Times</i>, and in the witness-box the whole story came out, all the
efforts of Sir Charles Russell in cross-examination failing to shake
his testimony, or to impair the impression of iron tenacity and
absolute truthfulness which his bearing conveyed. His career,
however, for good or evil, was at an end. He published the
story of his life, <i>Twenty-five Years in the Secret Service</i>, and
it had an immense circulation. But he had to be constantly
guarded, his acquaintances were hampered from seeing him, and
he was the victim of a painful disease, of which he died on the
1st of April 1894. The report of the Parnell Commission is his
monument.</p>

Italy, capital of the province of Lecce, 24 m. S.E. of Brindisi
by rail. Pop. (1906) 35,179. The town is remarkable for the
number of buildings of the 17th century, in the rococo style,
which it contains; among these are the cathedral of S. Oronzo,
and the churches of S. Chiara, S. Croce, S. Domenico, &amp;c., the
Seminario, and the Prefettura (the latter contains a museum,
with a collection of Greek vases, &amp;c.). Buildings of an earlier
period are not numerous, but the fine portal of the Romanesque
church of SS. Nicola e Cataldo, built by Tancred in 1180, may
be noted. Another old church is S. Maria di Cerrate, near the
town. Lecce contains a large government tobacco factory,
and is the centre of a fertile agricultural district. To the E.
7¬Ω m. is the small harbour of S. Cataldo, reached by electric
tramway. Lecce is quite close to the site of the ancient
Lupiae, equidistant (25 m.) from Brundusium and Hydruntum,
remains of which are mentioned as existing up to the 15th century.
A colony was founded there in Roman times, and Hadrian made
a harbour&mdash;no doubt at S. Cataldo. Hardly a mile west was
Rudiae, the birthplace of the poet Ennius, spoken of by Silius
Italicus as worthy of mention for that reason alone. Its site
was marked by the now deserted village of Rugge. The name
Lycea, or Lycia, begins to appear in the 6th century. The
city was for some time held by counts of Norman blood, among
whom the most noteworthy is Bohemond, son of Robert Guiscard.
It afterwards passed to the Orsini. The rank of provincial
capital was bestowed by Ferdinand of Aragon in acknowledgment
of the fidelity of Lecce to his cause.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LECCO,<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> a town of Lombardy, in the province of Como, 32 m.
by rail N. by E. of Milan, and reached by steamer from Como,
673 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901) 10,352. It is situated
near the southern extremity of the eastern branch of the Lake of
Como, which is frequently distinguished as the Lake of Lecco.
At Lecco begins the line (run by electricity) to Colico, whence
there are branches to Chiavenna and Sondrio; and another
line runs to Bergamo. To the south the Adda is crossed by a
fine bridge originally constructed in 1335, and rebuilt in 1609
by Fuentes. Lecco, in spite of its antiquity, presents a modern
appearance, almost the only old building being its castle, of which
a part remains. Its schools are particularly good. Besides
iron-works, there are copper-works, brass-foundries, olive-oil
mills and a manufacture of wax candles; and silk-spinning,
cotton-spinning and wood-carving. In the neighbourhood
is the villa of Caleotto, the residence of Alessandro Manzoni,
who in his <i>Promessi Sposi</i>, has left a full description of the district.
A statue has been erected to him.</p>

<p>In the 11th century Lecco, previously the seat of a marquisate,
was presented to the bishops of Como by Otto II.; but in the
12th century it passed to the archbishops of Milan, and in 1127
it assisted the Milanese in the destruction of Como. During the
13th century it was struggling for its existence with the metropolitan
city; and its fate seemed to be sealed when the Visconti
drove its inhabitants across the lake to Valmadrera, and forbade
them to raise their town from its ashes. But in a few years
the people returned; Azzone Visconti made Lecco a strong
fortress, and in 1335 united it with the Milanese territory by a
bridge across the Adda. During the 15th and 16th centuries
the citadel of Lecco was an object of endless contention. In
1647 the town with its territory was made a countship. Morone,
Charles V.&rsquo;s Italian chancellor, was born in Lecco.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LECH<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> (<i>Licus</i>), a river of Germany in the kingdom of Bavaria,
177 m. long, with a drainage basin of 2550 sq. m. It rises in
the Vorarlberg Alps, at an altitude of 6120 ft. It winds out of
the gloomy limestone mountains, flows in a north-north-easterly
direction, and enters the plains at F√ºssen (2580 ft.), where it
forms rapids and a fall, then pursues a northerly course past
Augsburg, where it receives the Wertach, and joins the Danube
from the right just below Donauw√∂rth (1330 ft.). It is not
navigable, owing to its torrential character and the gravel beds
which choke its channel. More than once great historic events
have been decided upon its banks. On the Lechfeld, a stony
waste some miles long, between the Lech and the Wertach, the
emperor Otto I. defeated the Hungarians in August 955. Tilly,
in attempting to defend the passage of the stream at Rain against
the forces of Gustavus Adolphus, was fatally wounded, on the
5th of April 1632. The river was formerly the boundary between
Bavaria and Swabia.</p>

east-central France in the department of Loire, 7¬Ω m. S.W.
of St √âtienne by rail, on the Ondaine, a tributary of the Loire.
Pop. (1906) town, 7525; commune, 12,011. Coal is mined in
the neighbourhood, and there are forges, steel works, manufactures
of tools and other iron goods, and silk mills. The feudal
castle of Feugerolles on a hill to the south-east dates in part
from the 11th century.</p>

<p>Between Le Chambon and St √âtienne is La Ricamarie (pop.

of the galleries of a number of these mines are on fire, probably
from spontaneous combustion. According to popular tradition
these fires date from the time of the Saracens; more authentically
from the 15th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE CHAPELIER, ISAAC REN√â GUY<a name="ar158" id="ar158"></a></span> (1754-1794), French
politician, was born at Rennes on the 12th of June 1754, his
father being <i>b√¢tonnier</i> of the corporation of lawyers in that town.
He entered his father&rsquo;s profession, and had some success as an
orator. In 1789 he was elected as a deputy to the States General
by the Tiers-√âtat of the <i>s√©n√©chauss√©e</i> of Rennes. He adopted
advanced opinions, and was one of the founders of the Breton
Club (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jacobin Club</a></span>); his influence in the Constituent
Assembly was considerable, and on the 3rd of August 1789 he
was elected its president. Thus he presided over the Assembly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>354</span>
during the important period following the 4th of August; he
took an active part in the debates, and was a leading member
of the committee which drew up the new constitution; he
further presented a report on the liberty of theatres and on
literary copyright. He was also conspicuous as opposing Robespierre
when he proposed that members of the Constituent
Assembly should not be eligible for election to the proposed new
Assembly. After the flight of the king to Varennes (20th of June
1792), his opinions became more moderate, and on the 29th of
September he brought forward a motion to restrict the action
of the clubs. This, together with a visit which he paid to England
in 1792 made him suspect, and he was denounced on his return
for conspiring with foreign nations. He went into hiding, but
was discovered in consequence of a pamphlet which he published
to defend himself, arrested and condemned to death by the
Revolutionary Tribunal. He was executed at Paris on the
22nd of April 1794.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LECHLER, GOTTHARD VICTOR<a name="ar159" id="ar159"></a></span> (1811-1888), German
Lutheran theologian, was born on the 18th of April 1811 at
Kloster Reichenbach in W√ºrttemberg. He studied at T√ºbingen
under F. C. Baur, and became in 1858 pastor of the church of
St Thomas, professor Ordinarius of historical theology and
superintendent of the Lutheran church of Leipzig. He died
on the 26th of December 1888. A disciple of Neander, he
belonged to the extreme right of the school of mediating theologians.
He is important as the historian of early Christianity
and of the pre-Reformation period. Although F. C. Baur was
his teacher, he did not attach himself to the T√ºbingen school;
in reply to the contention that there are traces of a sharp conflict
between two parties, Paulinists and Petrinists, he says that
&ldquo;we find variety coupled with agreement, and unity with difference,
between Paul and the earlier apostles; we recognize the
one spirit in the many gifts.&rdquo; His <i>Das apostolische und das
nachapostolische Zeitalter</i> (1851), which developed out of a prize
essay (1849), passed through three editions in Germany (3rd
ed., 1885), and was translated into English (2 vols., 1886). The
work which in his own opinion was his greatest, <i>Johann von
Wiclif und die Vorgeschichte der Reformation</i> (2 vols., 1873),
appeared in English with the title <i>John Wiclif and his English
Precursors</i> (1878, new ed., 1884). An earlier work, <i>Geschichte
des engl. De√Øsmus</i> (1841), is still regarded as a valuable contribution
to the study of religious thought in England.</p>

and Robert Grosseteste (1867). He wrote part of the commentary

<p><span class="bold">LECKY, WILLIAM EDWARD HARTPOLE<a name="ar160" id="ar160"></a></span> (1838-1903),
Irish historian and publicist, was born at Newtown Park, near
Dublin, on the 26th of March 1838, being the eldest son of
John Hartpole Lecky, whose family had for many generations
been landowners in Ireland. He was educated at Kingstown,
Armagh, and Cheltenham College, and at Trinity College, Dublin,
where he graduated B.A. in 1859 and M.A. in 1863, and where,
with a view to becoming a clergyman in the Irish Protestant
Church, he went through a course of divinity. In 1860 he
published anonymously a small book entitled <i>The Religious
Tendencies of the Age</i>, but on leaving college he abandoned his
first intention and turned to historical work. In 1861 he published
<i>Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland</i>, a brief sketch of the
lives and work of Swift, Flood, Grattan and O&rsquo;Connell, which
gave decided promise of his later admirable work in the same
field. This book, originally published anonymously, was republished
in 1871; and the essay on Swift, rewritten and amplified,
appeared again in 1897 as an introduction to a new edition of
Swift&rsquo;s works. Two learned surveys of certain aspects of history
followed: <i>A History of the Rise and Influence of Rationalism
in Europe</i> (2 vols., 1865), and <i>A History of European Morals
from Augustus to Charlemagne</i> (2 vols., 1869). Some criticism
was aroused by these books, especially by the last named, with
its opening dissertation on &ldquo;the natural history of morals,&rdquo;
but both have been generally accepted as acute and suggestive
commentaries upon a wide range of facts. Lecky then devoted
himself to the chief work of his life, <i>A History of England during
the Eighteenth Century</i>, vols. i. and ii. of which appeared in
1878, and vols. vii. and viii. (completing the work) in 1890.
His object was &ldquo;to disengage from the great mass of facts those
which relate to the permanent forces of the nation, or which
indicate some of the more enduring features of national life,&rdquo;
and in the carrying out of this task Lecky displays many of the
qualities of a great historian. The work is distinguished by the
lucidity of its style, but the fulness and extent of the authorities
referred to, and, above all, by the judicial impartiality maintained
by the author throughout. These qualities are perhaps most
conspicuous and most valuable in the chapters which deal
with the history of Ireland, and in the cabinet edition of 1892,
in 12 vols. (frequently reprinted) this part of the work is separated
from the rest, and occupies five volumes under the title of <i>A
History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century</i>. A volume of
<i>Poems</i>, published in 1891, was characterized by a certain frigidity
and by occasional lapses into commonplace, objections which
may also be fairly urged against much of Lecky&rsquo;s prose-writing.
In 1896 he published two volumes entitled <i>Democracy and
Liberty</i>, in which he considered, with special reference to Great
Britain, France and America, some of the tendencies of modern
democracies. The somewhat gloomy conclusions at which he
arrived provoked much criticism both in Great Britain and
America, which was renewed when he published in a new edition
(1899) an elaborate and very depreciatory estimate of Gladstone,
then recently dead. This work, though essentially different
from the author&rsquo;s purely historical writings, has many of their
merits, though it was inevitable that other minds should take
a different view of the evidence. In <i>The Map of Life</i> (1900)
he discussed in a popular style some of the ethical problems
which arise in everyday life. In 1903 he published a revised
and greatly enlarged edition of <i>Leaders of Public Opinion in
Ireland</i>, in two volumes, from which the essay on Swift was
omitted and that on O&rsquo;Connell was expanded into a complete
biography of the great advocate of repeal of the Union. Though
always a keen sympathizer with the Irish people in their misfortunes
and aspirations, and though he had criticized severely
the methods by which the Act of Union was passed, Lecky, who
grew up as a moderate Liberal, was from the first strenuously
opposed to Gladstone&rsquo;s policy of Home Rule, and in 1895 he
was returned to parliament as Unionist member for Dublin
University. In 1897 he was made a privy councillor, and among
the coronation honours in 1902 he was nominated an original
member of the new Order of Merit. His university honours
included the degree of LL.D. from Dublin, St Andrews and
Glasgow, the degree of D.C.L. from Oxford and the degree of
Litt.D. from Cambridge. In 1894 he was elected corresponding
member of the Institute of France. He contributed occasionally
to periodical literature, and two of his addresses, <i>The Political
Value of History</i> (1892) and <i>The Empire, its Value and its Growth</i>
(1893), were published. He died in London on the 22nd of
October 1903. He married in 1871 Elizabeth, baroness de
Dedem, daughter of baron de Dedem, a general in the Dutch
service, but had no children. Mrs Lecky contributed to various
reviews a number of articles, chiefly on historical and political
subjects. A volume of Lecky&rsquo;s <i>Historical and Political Essays</i>
was published posthumously (London, 1908).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE CLERC<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Clericus</span>], <span class="bold">JEAN</span> (1657-1736), French Protestant
theologian, was born on the 19th of March 1657 at Geneva,
where his father, Stephen Le Clerc, was professor of Greek.
The family originally belonged to the neighbourhood of Beauvais
in France, and several of its members acquired some name in
literature. Jean Le Clerc applied himself to the study of philosophy
under J. R. Chouet (1642-1731) the Cartesian, and
attended the theological lectures of P. Mestrezat, Franz Turretin
and Louis Tronchin (1629-1705). In 1678-1679 he spent some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>355</span>
time at Grenoble as tutor in a private family; on his return to
Geneva he passed his examinations and received ordination.
Soon afterwards he went to Saumur, where in 1679 were published
<i>Liberii de Sancto Amore Epistolae Theologicae</i> (Irenopoli:
Typis Philalethianis), usually attributed to him; they deal with
the doctrine of the Trinity, the hypostatic union of the two
natures in Jesus Christ, original sin, and the like, in a manner
sufficiently far removed from that of the conventional orthodoxy
of the period. In 1682 he went to London, where he remained
six months, preaching on alternate Sundays in the Walloon
church and in the Savoy chapel. Passing to Amsterdam he was
introduced to John Locke and to Philip v. Limborch, professor
at the Remonstrant college; the acquaintance with Limborch
soon ripened into a close friendship, which strengthened his
preference for the Remonstrant theology, already favourably
known to him by the writings of his grand-uncle, Stephan Curcellaeus
(d. 1645) and by those of Simon Episcopius. A last attempt
to live at Geneva, made at the request of relatives there, satisfied
him that the theological atmosphere was uncongenial, and in
1684 he finally settled at Amsterdam, first as a moderately
successful preacher, until ecclesiastical jealousy shut him out
from that career, and afterwards as professor of philosophy,
belles-lettres and Hebrew in the Remonstrant seminary. This
appointment, which he owed to Limborch, he held from 1684,
and in 1712 on the death of his friend he was called to occupy
the chair of church history also. His suspected Socinianism
was the cause, it is said, of his exclusion from the chair of dogmatic
theology. Apart from his literary labours, Le Clerc&rsquo;s
life at Amsterdam was uneventful. In 1691 he married a
daughter of Gregorio Leti. From 1728 onward he was subject
to repeated strokes of paralysis, and he died on the 8th of January
1736.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A full catalogue of the publications of Le Clerc will be found,
with biographical material, in E. and E. Haag&rsquo;s <i>France Protestante</i>
(where seventy-three works are enumerated), or in J. G. de Chauffepi√©&rsquo;s
Dictionnaire. Only the most important of these can be mentioned
here. In 1685 he published <i>Sentimens de quelques th√©ologiens
de Hollande sur l&rsquo;histoire critique du Vieux Testament compos√©e par
le P. Richard Simon</i>, in which, while pointing out what he believed
to be the faults of that author, he undertook to make some positive
contributions towards a right understanding of the Bible. Among
these last may be noted his argument against the Mosaic authorship
of the Pentateuch, his views as to the manner in which the
five books were composed, his opinions (singularly free for the time
in which he lived) on the subject of inspiration in general, and
particularly as to the inspiration of Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
Canticles. Richard Simon&rsquo;s <i>R√©ponse</i> (1686) elicited from Le Clerc
a <i>D√©fense des sentimens</i> in the same year, which was followed by a new
<i>R√©ponse</i> (1687). In 1692 appeared his <i>Logica sive Ars Ratiocinandi</i>,
and also <i>Ontologia et Pneumatologia</i>; these, with the <i>Physica</i>
(1695), are incorporated with the <i>Opera Philosophica</i>, which have
passed through several editions. In 1693 his series of Biblical
commentaries began with that on Genesis; the series was not completed
until 1731. The portion relating to the New Testament
books included the paraphrase and notes of Henry Hammond
(1605-1660). Le Clerc&rsquo;s commentary had a great influence in
breaking up traditional prejudices and showing the necessity for a
more scientific inquiry into the origin and meaning of the biblical
books. It was on all sides hotly attacked. His <i>Ars Critica</i> appeared
in 1696, and, in continuation, <i>Epistolae Criticae et Ecclesiasticae</i> in
1700. Le Clerc&rsquo;s new edition of the <i>Apostolic Fathers</i> of Johann
Cotelerius (1627-1686), published in 1698, marked an advance in
the critical study of these documents. But the greatest literary
influence of Le Clerc was probably that which he exercised over
his contemporaries by means of the serials, or, if one may so call
them, reviews, of which he was editor. These were the <i>Biblioth√®que
universelle et historiqnijkue</i> (Amsterdam, 25 vols. 12 mo., 1686-1693),
begun with J. C. de la Croze; the <i>Biblioth√®que choisie</i> (Amsterdam,
28 vols., 1703-1713); and the <i>Biblioth√®que ancienne et moderne</i>,
(29 vols., 1714-1726).</p>

<p>See Le Clerc&rsquo;s <i>Parrhasiana ou pens√©es sur des mati√®res de critique,
d&rsquo;histoire, de morale, et de politique: avec la d√©fense de divers ouvrages
de M. L. C. par Th√©odore Parrhase</i> (Amsterdam, 1699); and <i>Vita et
opera ad annum MDCCXI., amici ejus opusculum, philosophicis
Clerici operibus subjiciendum</i>, also attributed to himself. The
supplement to Hammond&rsquo;s notes was translated into English in
1699, <i>Parrhasiana, or Thoughts on Several Subjects</i>, in 1700, the
<i>Harmony of the Gospels</i> in 1701, and <i>Twelve Dissertations out of M.
Le Clerc&rsquo;s Genesis</i> in 1696.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LECOCQ, ALEXANDRE CHARLES<a name="ar162" id="ar162"></a></span> (1832-&emsp;&emsp;), French
musical composer, was born in Paris, on the 3rd of June 1832.
He was admitted into the Conservatoire in 1849, being already
an accomplished pianist. He studied under Bazin, Hal√©vy and
Benoist, winning the first prize for harmony in 1850, and the
second prize for fugue in 1852. He first gained notice by dividing
with Bizet the first prize for an operetta in a competition instituted
by Offenbach. His operetta, <i>Le Docteur miracle</i>, was
performed at the Bouffes Parisiens in 1857. After that he wrote
constantly for theatres, but produced nothing worthy of mention
until <i>Fleur de th√©</i> (1868), which ran for more than a hundred
nights. <i>Les Cent vierges</i> (1872) was favourably received also,
but all his previous successes were cast into the shade by <i>La
Fille de Madame Angot</i> (Paris, 1873; London, 1873), which was
performed for 400 nights consecutively, and has since gained and
retained enormous popularity. After 1873 Lecocq produced a
large number of comic operas, though he never equalled his early
triumph in <i>La Fille de Madame Angot</i>. Among the best of his
pieces are <i>Girofl√©-Girofla</i> (Paris and London, 1874); <i>Les Pr√©s
Saint-Gervais</i> (Paris and London, 1874); <i>La Petite Mari√©e</i>
(Paris, 1875; London, 1876, revived as <i>The Scarlet Feather</i>, 1897);
<i>Le Petit Duc</i> (Paris, 1878; London, as <i>The Little Duke</i>, 1878);
<i>La Petite Mademoiselle</i> (Paris, 1879; London, 1880); <i>Le Jour
et la Nuit</i> (Paris, 1881; London, as <i>Manola</i>, 1882); <i>Le C&oelig;ur et
la main</i> (Paris, 1882; London, as <i>Incognita</i>, 1893); <i>La Princesse
des Canaries</i> (Paris, 1883; London, as <i>Pepita</i>, 1888). In 1899
a ballet by Lecocq, entitled <i>Le Cygne</i>, was staged at the Op√©ra
Comique, Paris; and in 1903 <i>Yetta</i> was produced at Brussels.</p>

on the 13th of December 1764. Deputy for his department to
the Legislative Assembly in 1792, and to the Convention in the
same year, he voted for &ldquo;the death of the tyrant.&rdquo; His association
with the Girondins nearly involved him in their fall, in
spite of his vigorous republicanism. He took part in the revolution
of Thermidor, but protested against the establishment of
the Directory, and continually pressed for severer measures
against the <i>√©migr√©s</i>, and even their relations who had remained
in France. He was secretary and then president of the Council
of Five Hundred, and under the Consulate a member of the
Tribunate. He took no part in public affairs under the Empire,
but was lieutenant-general of police for south-east France
during the Hundred Days. After Waterloo he took ship from
Toulon, but the ship was driven back by a storm and he narrowly
escaped massacre at Marseilles. After six weeks&rsquo; imprisonment
in the Ch√¢teau d&rsquo;If he returned to Paris, escaping, after the
proscription of the regicides, to Brussels, where he died on the

Huguenot descent, was born in Liberty county, Georgia, on the
26th of February 1823. He was educated at Franklin College,
Georgia, where he graduated (1841); he afterwards studied
medicine and received his degree at the New York College of
Physicians and Surgeons in 1845. After practising for three
or four years at Macon, Georgia, he entered Harvard, and studied
natural history under L. Agassiz. An excursion made with
Professors J. Hall and Agassiz to the Helderberg mountains of
New York developed a keen interest in geology. After graduating
at Harvard, Le Conte in 1851 accompanied Agassiz on an
expedition to study the Florida reefs. On his return he became
professor of natural science in Oglethorpe University, Georgia;
and from 1852 to 1856 professor of natural history and geology
in Franklin College. From 1857 to 1869 he was professor of
chemistry and geology in South Carolina College, and he was
then appointed professor of geology and natural history in the
university of California, a post which he held until his death.
He published a series of papers on monocular and binocular
vision, and also on psychology. His chief contributions, however,
related to geology, and in all he wrote he was lucid and
philosophical. He described the fissure-eruptions in western
America, discoursed on earth-crust movements and their causes
and on the great features of the earth&rsquo;s surface. As separate
works he published <i>Elements of Geology</i> (1878, 5th ed. 1889);

French poet, was born in the island of R√©union on the 22nd of
October 1818. His father, an army surgeon, who brought him
up with great severity, sent him to travel in the East Indies
with a view to preparing him for a commercial life. After this
voyage he went to Rennes to complete his education, studying
especially Greek, Italian and history. He returned once or
twice to R√©union, but in 1846 settled definitely in Paris. His
first volume, <i>La V√©nus de Milo</i>, attracted to him a number
of friends many of whom were passionately devoted to classical
literature. In 1873 he was made assistant librarian at the
Luxembourg; in 1886 he was elected to the Academy in succession
to Victor Hugo. His <i>Po√®mes antiques</i> appeared in 1852;
<i>Po√®mes et po√©sies</i> in 1854; <i>Le Chemin de la croix</i> in 1859; the
<i>Po√®mes barbares</i>, in their first form, in 1862; <i>Les Erinnyes</i>,
a tragedy after the Greek model, in 1872; for which occasional
music was provided by Jules Massenet; the <i>Po√®mes tragiques</i>
in 1884; <i>L&rsquo;Apollonide</i>, another classical tragedy, in 1888;
and two posthumous volumes, <i>Derniers po√®mes</i> in 1899, and
<i>Premi√®res po√©sies et lettres intimes</i> in 1902. In addition to his
original work in verse, he published a series of admirable prose

<p>In Leconte de Lisle the Parnassian movement seems to
crystallize. His verse is clear, sonorous, dignified, deliberate
in movement, classically correct in rhythm, full of exotic local
colour, of savage names, of realistic rhetoric. It has its own
kind of romance, in its &ldquo;legend of the ages,&rdquo; so different from
Hugo&rsquo;s, so much fuller of scholarship and the historic sense,
yet with far less of human pity. Coldness cultivated as a kind
of artistic distinction seems to turn all his poetry to marble,
in spite of the fire at its heart. Most of Leconte de Lisle&rsquo;s poems
are little chill epics, in which legend is fossilized. They have
the lofty monotony of a single conception of life and of the
universe. He sees the world as what Byron called it, &ldquo;a glorious
blunder,&rdquo; and desires only to stand a little apart from the
throng, meditating scornfully. Hope, with him, becomes no
more than this desperate certainty:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f90">&ldquo;Tu te tairas, √¥ voix sinistre des vivants!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind">His only prayer is to Death, &ldquo;divine Death,&rdquo; that it may gather
its children to its breast:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Affranchis-nous du temps, du nombre et de l&rsquo;espace,</p>
<p class="i05">Et rends-nous le repos que la vie a troubl√©!&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">The interval which is his he accepts with something of the
defiance of his own Cain, refusing to fill it with the triviality
of happiness, waiting even upon beauty with a certain inflexible
austerity. He listens and watches, throughout the world, for
echoes and glimpses of great tragic passions, languid with fire
in the East, a tumultuous conflagration in the middle ages,
a sombre darkness in the heroic ages of the North. The burning
emptiness of the desert attracts him, the inexplicable melancholy
of the dogs that bark at the moon; he would interpret the
jaguar&rsquo;s dreams, the sleep of the condor. He sees nature with
the same wrathful impatience as man, praising it for its destructive
energies, its haste to crush out human life before the stars
fall into chaos, and the world with them, as one of the least
of stars. He sings the &ldquo;Dies Irae&rdquo; exultingly; only seeming
to desire an end of God as well as of man, universal nothingness.
He conceives that he does well to be angry, and this anger is
indeed the personal note of his pessimism; but it leaves him
somewhat apart from the philosophical poets, too fierce for
wisdom and not rapturous enough for poetry.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE COQ, ROBERT<a name="ar166" id="ar166"></a></span> (d. 1373), French bishop, was born at
Montdidier, although he belonged to a bourgeois family of
Orl√©ans, where he first attended school before coming to Paris.
In Paris he became advocate to the parlement (1347); then
King John appointed him master of requests, and in 1351,
a year during which he received many other honours, he became
bishop of Laon. At the opening of 1354 he was sent with the
cardinal of Boulogne, Pierre I., duke of Bourbon, and Jean VI.,
count of Vendome, to Mantes to treat with Charles the Bad,
king of Navarre, who had caused the constable, Charles of Spain,
to be assassinated, and from this time dates his connexion with
this king. At the meeting of the estates which opened in Paris
in October 1356 Le Coq played a leading r√¥le and was one of
the most outspoken of the orators, especially when petitions
were presented to the dauphin Charles, denouncing the bad
government of the realm and demanding the banishment of
the royal councillors. Soon, however, the credit of the estates
having gone down, he withdrew to his diocese, but at the request
of the bourgeois of Paris he speedily returned. The king of
Navarre had succeeded in escaping from prison and had entered
Paris, where his party was in the ascendant; and Robert le Coq
became the most powerful person in his council. No one dared
to contradict him, and he brought into it whom he pleased.
He did not scruple to reveal to the king of Navarre secret deliberations,
but his fortune soon turned. He ran great danger at the
estates of Compi√®gne in May 1358, where his dismissal was
demanded, and he had to flee to St Denis, where Charles the
Bad and √âtienne Marcel came to find him. After the death
of Marcel, he tried, unsuccessfully, to deliver Laon, his episcopal
town, to the king of Navarre, and he was excluded from the
amnesty promised in the treaty of Calais (1360) by King John
to the partisans of Charles the Bad. His temporalities had
been seized, and he was obliged to flee from France. In 1363,
thanks to the support of the king of Navarre, he was given the
bishopric of Calahorra in the kingdom of Aragon, which he
administered until his death in 1373.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LECOUVREUR, ADRIENNE<a name="ar167" id="ar167"></a></span> (1692-1730), French actress,
was born on the 5th of April 1692, at Damery, Marne, the
daughter of a hatter, Robert Couvreur. She had an unhappy
childhood in Paris. She showed a natural talent for declamation
and was instructed by La Grand, <i>soci√©taire</i> of the Com√©die
Fran√ßaise, and with his help she obtained a provincial engagement.
It was not until 1717, after a long apprenticeship, that
she made her Paris d√©but as Electre, in Cr√©billon&rsquo;s tragedy
of that name, and Ang√©lique in Moli√®re&rsquo;s <i>George Dandin</i>. Her
success was so great that she was immediately received into
the Com√©die Fran√ßaise, and for thirteen years she was the
queen of tragedy there, attaining a popularity never before
accorded an actress. She is said to have played no fewer than
1184 times in a hundred r√¥les, of which she created twenty-two.
She owed her success largely to her courage in abandoning the
stilted style of elocution of her predecessors for a naturalness
of delivery and a touching simplicity of pathos that delighted
and moved her public. In Baron, who returned to the stage at
the age of sixty-seven, she had an able and powerful coadjutor
in changing the stage traditions of generations. The jealousy
she aroused was partly due to her social successes, which were
many, in spite of the notorious freedom of her manner of life.
She was on visiting and dining terms with half the court, and her
<i>salon</i> was frequented by Voltaire and all the other notables
and men of letters. She was the mistress of Maurice de Saxe
from 1721, and sold her plate and jewels to supply him with
funds for his ill-starred adventures as duke of Courland. By
him she had a daughter, her third, who was grandmother of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>357</span>
the father of George Sand. Adrienne Lecouvreur died on
the 20th of March 1730. She was denied the last rites of the
Church, and her remains were refused burial in consecrated
ground. Voltaire, in a fine poem on her death, expressed his
indignation at the barbarous treatment accorded to the woman
whose &ldquo;friend, admirer, lover&rdquo; he was.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE CREUSOT,<a name="ar168" id="ar168"></a></span> a town of east-central France in the department
of Sa√¥ne-et-Loire, 55 m. S.W. of Dijon on the Paris-Lyon
railway. Pop. (1906), town, 22,535; commune, 33,437. Situated
at the foot of lofty hills in a district rich in coal and iron, it has
the most extensive iron works in France. The coal bed of
Le Creusot was discovered in the 13th century; but it was not
till 1774 that the first workshops were founded there. The royal
crystal works were transferred from S√®vres to Le Creusot in
1787, but this industry came to an end in 1831. Meanwhile
two or three enterprises for the manufacture of metal had ended
in failure, and it was only in 1836 that the foundation of iron
works by Adolphe and Eug√®ne Schneider definitely inaugurated
the industrial prosperity of the place. The works supplied large
quantities of war material to the French armies during the
Crimean and Franco-German wars. Since that time they have
continuously enlarged the scope of their operations, which now
embrace the manufacture of steel, armour-plate, guns, ordnance-stores,
locomotives, electrical machinery and engineering material
of every description. A network of railways about 37 m. in
length connects the various branches of the works with each
other and with the neighbouring Canal du Centre. Special
attention is paid to the welfare of the workers who, not including
the miners, number about 12,000, and good schools have been
established. In 1897 the ordnance-manufacture of the Soci√©t√©
des Forges et Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e at Havre was acquired
by the Company, which also has important branches at Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne,
where ship-building and bridge-construction is carried
on, and at Cette (H√©rault).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LECTERN<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> (through O. Fr. <i>leitrun</i>, from Late Lat. <i>lectrum</i>, or
<i>lectrinum</i>, <i>legere</i>, to read; the French equivalent is <i>lutrin</i>;
Ital. <i>leggio</i>; Ger. <i>Lesepult</i>), in the furniture of certain Christian
churches, a reading-desk, used more especially for the reading
of the lessons and in the Anglican Church practically confined
to that purpose. In the early Christian Church this was done
from the ambo (<i>q.v.</i>), but in the 15th century, when the books
were often of great size, it became necessary to provide a lectern
to hold them. These were either in wood or metal, and many
fine examples still exist; one at Detling in wood, in which there
are shelves on all four sides to hold books, is perhaps the most
elaborate. Brass lecterns, as in the colleges of Oxford and
Cambridge, are common; in the usual type the book is supported
on the outspread wings of an eagle or pelican, which is raised
on a moulded stem, carried on three projecting ledges or feet
with lions on them. In the example in Norwich cathedral,
the pelican supporting the book stands on a rock enclosed with
a rich cresting of Gothic tabernacle work; the central stem or
pillar, on which this rests, is supported by miniature projecting
buttresses, standing on a moulded base with lions on it.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LECTION, LECTIONARY.<a name="ar170" id="ar170"></a></span> The custom of reading the books
of Moses in the synagogues on the Sabbath day was a very ancient
one in the Jewish Church. The addition of lections (<i>i.e.</i> readings)
from the prophetic books had been made afterwards and was in
existence in our Lord&rsquo;s time, as may be gathered from such
passages as St Luke iv. 16-20, xvi. 29. This element in
synagogue worship was taken over with others into the Christian
divine service, additions being made to it from the writings
of the apostles and evangelists. We find traces of such additions
within the New Testament itself in such directions as are contained
in Col. iv. 16; 1 Thess. v. 27.</p>

<p>From the 2nd century onwards references multiply, though
the earlier references do not prove the existence of a fixed
lectionary or order of lessons, but rather point the other way.
Justin Martyr, describing divine worship in the middle of the
2nd century says: &ldquo;On the day called Sunday all who live in
cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the
memoirs of the Apostles, or the writings of the Prophets are
read as long as time permits&rdquo; (<i>Apol.</i> i. cap. 67). Tertullian
about half a century later makes frequent reference to the reading
of Holy Scripture in public worship (<i>Apol.</i> 39; <i>De praescript.</i>
36; <i>De amina</i>, 9).</p>

<p>In the canons of Hippolytus in the first half of the 3rd century
we find this direction: &ldquo;Let presbyters, subdeacons and readers,
and all the people assemble daily in the church at time of cock-crow,
and betake themselves to prayers, to psalms and to the
reading of the Scriptures, according to the command of the
Apostles, until I come attend to reading&rdquo; (canon xxi.).</p>

<p>But there are traces of fixed lessons coming into existence in
the course of this century; Origen refers to the book of Job
being read in Holy Week (<i>Commentaries on Job</i>, lib. i.). Allusions
of a similar kind in the 4th century are frequent. John Cassian
(<i>c.</i> 380) tells us that throughout Egypt the Psalms were divided
into groups of twelve, and that after each group there followed
two lessons, one from the Old, one from the New Testament
(<i>De caenob. inst.</i> ii. 4), implying but not absolutely stating that
there was a fixed order of such lessons just as there was of the
Psalms. St Basil the Great mentions fixed lessons on certain
occasions taken from Isaiah, Proverbs, St Matthew and Acts
(Hom. xiii. <i>De bapt.</i>). From Chrysostom (Hom. lxiii <i>in Act.</i>
&amp;c.), and Augustine (Tract. vi. <i>in Joann.</i> &amp;c.) we learn that
Genesis was read in Lent, Job and Jonah in Passion Week, the
Acts of the Apostles in Eastertide, lessons on the Passion on
Good Friday and on the Resurrection on Easter Day. In the
<i>Apostolical Constitutions</i> (ii. 57) the following service is described
and enjoined. First come two lessons from the Old Testament
by a reader, the whole of the Old Testament being made use of
except the books of the Apocrypha. The Psalms of David are
then to be sung. Next the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles
of Paul are to be read, and finally the four Gospels by a deacon
or a priest. Whether the selections were <i>ad libitum</i> or according
to a fixed table of lessons we are not informed. Nothing in the
shape of a lectionary is extant older than the 8th century,
though there is evidence that Claudianus Mamercus made one
for the church at Vienne in 450, and that Musaeus made one for
the church at Marseilles <i>c.</i> 458. The <i>Liber comitis</i> formerly
attributed to St Jerome must be three, or nearly three, centuries
later than that saint, and the Luxeuil lectionary, or <i>Lectionarium
Gallicanum</i>, which Mabillon attributed to the 7th, cannot be
earlier than the 8th century; yet the oldest MSS. of the Gospels
have marginal marks, and sometimes actual interpolations,
which can only be accounted for as indicating the beginnings
and endings of liturgical lessons. The third council of Carthage
in 397 forbade anything but Holy Scripture to be read in church;
this rule has been adhered to so far as the liturgical epistle and
gospel, and occasional additional lessons in the Roman missal
are concerned, but in the divine office, on feasts when nine
lessons are read at matins, only the first three lessons are taken
from Holy Scripture, the next three being taken from the sermons
of ecclesiastical writers, and the last three from expositions of
the day&rsquo;s gospel; but sometimes the lives or <i>Passions</i> of the
saints, or of some particular saints, were substituted for any or
all of these breviary lessons.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LECTISTERNIUM<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>lectum sternere</i>, &ldquo;to spread a
couch&rdquo;; <span class="grk" title="str√¥mnai">&#963;&#964;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#957;&#945;&#943;</span> in Dion. Halic. xii. 9), in ancient Rome,
a propitiatory ceremony, consisting of a meal offered to gods
and goddesses, represented by their busts or statues, or by
portable figures of wood, with heads of bronze, wax or marble,
and covered with drapery. Another suggestion is that the
symbols of the gods consisted of bundles of sacred herbs, tied
together in the form of a head, covered by a waxen mask so as
to resemble a kind of bust (cf. the straw puppets called Argei).
These symbols were laid upon a couch (<i>lectus</i>), the left arm
resting on a cushion (<i>pulvinus</i>, whence the couch itself was often
called <i>pulvinar</i>) in the attitude of reclining. In front of the
couch, which was placed in the open street, a meal was set out
on a table. It is definitely stated by Livy (v. 13) that the
ceremony took place &ldquo;for the first time&rdquo; in Rome in the year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>358</span>
399 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, after the Sibylline books had been consulted by their
keepers and interpreters (<i>duumviri sacris faciendis</i>), on the
occasion of a pestilence. Three couches were prepared for
three pairs of gods&mdash;Apollo and Latona, Hercules and Diana,
Mercury and Neptune. The feast, which on that occasion lasted
for eight (or seven) days, was also celebrated by private individuals;
the citizens kept open house, quarrels were forgotten,
debtors and prisoners were released, and everything done to
banish sorrow. Similar honours were paid to other divinities
in subsequent times&mdash;Fortuna, Saturnus, Juno Regina of the
Aventine, the three Capitoline deities (Jupiter, Juno, Minerva),
and in 217, after the defeat of lake Trasimenus, a lectisternium
was held for three days to six pairs of gods, corresponding to the
twelve great gods of Olympus&mdash;Jupiter, Juno, Neptune, Minerva,
Mars, Venus, Apollo, Diana, Vulcan, Vesta, Mercury, Ceres.
In 205, alarmed by unfavourable prodigies, the Romans were
ordered to fetch the Great Mother of the gods from Pessinus in
Phrygia; in the following year the image was brought to Rome,
and a lectisternium held. In later times, the lectisternium
became of constant (even daily) occurrence, and was celebrated
in the different temples. Such celebrations must be distinguished
from those which were ordered, like the earlier lectisternia, by
the Sibylline books in special emergencies. Although undoubtedly
offerings of food were made to the gods in very early
Roman times on such occasions as the ceremony of <i>confarreatio</i>,
and the <i>epulum Jovis</i> (often confounded with the lectisternium),
it is generally agreed that the lectisternia were of Greek origin.
In favour of this may be mentioned: the similarity of the Greek
<span class="grk" title="Theoxenia">&#920;&#949;&#959;&#958;&#941;&#957;&#953;&#945;</span>, in which, however, the gods played the part of hosts;
the gods associated with it were either previously unknown to
Roman religion, though often concealed under Roman names,
or were provided with a new cult (thus Hercules was not worshipped
as at the Ara Maxima, where, according to Servius on
<i>Aeneid</i>, viii. 176 and Cornelius Balbus, <i>ap.</i> Macrobius, <i>Sat.</i> iii. 6,
a lectisternium was forbidden); the Sibylline books, which
decided whether a lectisternium was to be held or not, were of
Greek origin; the custom of reclining at meals was Greek.
Some, however, assign an Etruscan origin to the ceremony, the
Sibylline books themselves being looked upon as old Italian
&ldquo;black books.&rdquo; A probable explanation of the confusion
between the lectisternia and genuine old Italian ceremonies is
that, as the lectisternia became an almost everyday occurrence
in Rome, people forgot their foreign origin and the circumstances
in which they were first introduced, and then the word <i>pulvinar</i>
with its associations was transferred to times in which it had no
existence. In imperial times, according to Tacitus (<i>Annals</i>, xv.
44), chairs were substituted for couches in the case of goddesses,
and the lectisternium in their case became a sellisternium (the
reading, however, is not certain). This was in accordance with
Roman custom, since in the earliest times all the members of a
family sat at meals, and in later times at least the women and
children. This is a point of distinction between the original
practice at the lectisternium and the epulum Jovis, the goddesses
at the latter being provided with chairs, whereas in the lectisternium
they reclined. In Christian times the word was used for
a feast in memory of the dead (Sidonius Apollinaris, <i>Epistulae</i>,
iv. 15).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LECTOR,<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Reader</span>, a minor office-bearer in the Christian
Church. From an early period men have been set apart, under
the title of <i>anagnostae</i>, <i>lectores</i>, or readers, for the purpose of
reading Holy Scripture in church. We do not know what the
custom of the Church was in the first two centuries, the earliest
reference to readers, as an order, occurring in the writings of
Tertullian (<i>De praescript. haeret.</i> cap. 41); there are frequent
allusions to them in the writings of St Cyprian and afterwards.
Cornelius, bishop of Rome in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 251-252, in a well-known letter
mentions readers among the various church orders then existing
at Rome. In the <i>Apostolic Church Order</i> (canon 19), mention
is made of the qualifications and duties of a reader, but no
reference is made to their method of ordination. In the <i>Apostolic
Didascalia</i> there is recognition of three minor orders of men,
subdeacons, readers and singers, in addition to two orders of
women, deaconesses and widows. A century later, in the <i>Apostolic
Constitutions</i>, we find not only a recognition of readers, but
also a form of admission provided for them, consisting of the
imposition of hands and prayer (lib. viii. cap. 22). In Africa the
imposition of hands was not in use, but a Bible was handed to
the newly appointed reader with words of commission to read it,
followed by a prayer and a benediction (Fourth Council of
Carthage, can. 8). This is the ritual of the Roman Church of
to-day. With regard to age, the novels of Justinian (No. 123)
forbade any one to be admitted to the office of reader under the
age of eighteen.</p>

account Nemesis was the mother of Helen (<i>q.v.</i>) whom Leda
adopted as her daughter. This led to the identification of Leda
and Nemesis. In the usual later form of the story, Leda herself,
having been visited by Zeus in the form of a swan, produced
two eggs, from one of which came Helen, from the other Castor
and Pollux.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LE DAIM<a name="ar175" id="ar175"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Le Dain</span>), <span class="bold">OLIVIER</span> (d. 1484), favourite of
Louis XI. of France, was born of humble parentage at Thielt
near Courtrai in Flanders. Seeking his fortune at Paris, he
became court barber and valet to Louis XI., and so ingratiated
himself with the king that in 1474 he was ennobled under the title
Le Daim and in 1477 made comte de Meulant. In the latter year
he was sent to Burgundy to influence the young heiress of Charles
the Bold, but he was ridiculed and compelled to leave Ghent.
He thereupon seized and held Tournai for the French. Le Daim
had considerable talent for intrigue, and, according to his enemies,
could always be depended upon to execute the baser designs of
the king. He amassed a large fortune, largely by oppression
and violence, and was named gentleman-in-waiting, captain of
Loches, and governor of Saint-Quentin. He remained in
favour until the death of Louis XI., when the rebellious lords
were able to avenge the slights and insults they had suffered at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>359</span>
the hands of the royal barber. He was arrested on charges,
the nature of which is uncertain, tried before the parlement of
Paris, and on the 21st of May 1484 hanged at Montfaucon without
the knowledge of Charles VIII., who might have heeded his
father&rsquo;s request and spared the favourite. Le Daim&rsquo;s property
was given to the duke of Orleans.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEDBURY,<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span> a market town in the Ross parliamentary division
of Herefordshire, England, 14¬Ω m. E. of Hereford by the Great
Western railway, pleasantly situated on the south-western slope
of the Malvern Hills. Pop. of urban district (1901) 3259.
Cider and agricultural produce are the chief articles of trade,
and there are limestone quarries in the neighbouring hills. The
town contains many picturesque examples of timbered houses,
characteristic of the district, the principal being the Market
House (1633) elevated on massive pillars of oak. The fine
church of St Michael exhibits all the Gothic styles, the most
noteworthy features being the Norman chancel and west door,
and the remarkable series of ornate Decorated windows on the
north side. Among several charities is the hospital of St
Catherine, founded by Foliot, bishop of Hereford, in 1232. Hope
End, 2 m. N.E. of Ledbury, was the residence of Elizabeth
Barrett Browning during her early life. A clock-tower in the
town commemorates her.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Wall Hills Camp, supposed to be of British origin, is the earliest
evidence of a settlement near Ledbury (Liedeburge, Lidebury).
The manor was given to the see of Hereford in the 11th century;
but in 1561-1562 became crown property. As early as 1170-1171
an episcopal castle existed in Ledbury. The town was not incorporated,
but was early called a borough; and in 1295 and 1304-1305
returned two members to parliament. A fair on the day of
the decollation of John the Baptist was granted to the bishop in
1249. Of fairs which survived in 1792 those of the days of St
Philip and St James and St Barnabas were granted in 1584-1585;
those held on the Monday before Easter and St Thomas&rsquo;s day were
reputed ancient, but not those of the 12th of May, the 22nd of
June, the 2nd of October and the 21st of December. Existing fairs
are on the second Tuesday in every month and in October. A weekly
market, granted to the bishop by Stephen, John and Henry III.,
was obsolete in 1584-1585, when the present market of Tuesday was
authorized. The wool trade was considerable in the 14th century;
later Ledbury was inhabited by glovers and clothiers. The town
was deeply involved in the operations of the Civil Wars, being
occupied both by the royalist leader Prince Rupert and by the
Parliamentarian Colonel Birch.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEDGER<a name="ar177" id="ar177"></a></span> (from the English dialect forms <i>liggen</i> or <i>leggen</i>,
to lie or lay; in sense adapted from the Dutch substantive
<i>legger</i>), properly a book remaining regularly in one place, and so
used of the copies of the Scriptures and service books kept in
a church. The <i>New English Dictionary</i> quotes from Charles
Wriothesley&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle</i>, 1538 (ed. <i>Camden Soc.</i>, 1875, by W. D.
Hamilton), &ldquo;the curates should provide a booke of the bible
in Englishe, of the largest volume, to be a lidger in the same
church for the parishioners to read on.&rdquo; It is an application of
this original meaning that is found in the commercial usage
of the term for the principal book of account in a business house
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Book-Keeping</a></span>). Apart from these applications to various
forms of books, the word is used of the horizontal timbers in a
scaffold (<i>q.v.</i>) lying parallel to the face of a building, which support
the &ldquo;put logs&rdquo;; of a flat stone to cover a grave; and of a
stationary form of tackle and bait in angling. In the form
&ldquo;lieger&rdquo; the term was formerly frequently applied to a &ldquo;resident,&rdquo;

<p><span class="bold">LEDOCHOWSKI, MIECISLAUS JOHANN,<a name="ar178" id="ar178"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count</span> (1822-1902),
Polish cardinal, was born on the 29th of October 1822 in Gorki
(Russian Poland), and received his early education at the
gymnasium and seminary of Warsaw. After finishing his studies
at the Jesuit Accademia dei Nobili Ecclesiastici in Rome, which
strongly influenced his religious development and his attitude
towards church affairs, he was ordained in 1845. From 1856 to
1858 he represented the Roman See in Columbia, but on the
outbreak of the Columbian revolution had to return to Rome.
In 1861 Pope Pius IX. made him his nuncio at Brussels, and in
1865 he was made archbishop of Gnesen-Posen. His preconization
followed on the 8th of January 1866. This date marks the
beginning of the second period in Ledochowski&rsquo;s life; for during
the Prussian and German <i>Kulturkampf</i> he was one of the most
declared enemies of the state. It was only during the earliest
years of his appointment as archbishop that he entertained a
different view, invoking, for instance, an intervention of Prussia
in favour of the Roman Church, when it was oppressed by the
house of Savoy. On the 12th of December 1870 he presented
an effective memorandum on the subject at the headquarters
at Versailles. In 1872 the archbishop protested against the
demand of the government that religious teaching should be given
only in the German language, and in 1873 he addressed a circular
letter on this subject to the clergy of his diocese. The government
thereupon demanded a statement from the teachers of
religion as to whether they intended to obey it or the archbishop,
and on their declaring for the archbishop, dismissed them. The
count himself was called upon at the end of 1873 to lay aside his
office. On his refusing to do so, he was arrested between 3 and
4 o&rsquo;clock in the morning on the 3rd of February 1874 by Sta&#328;di
the director of police, and taken to the military prison of Ostrowo.
The pope made him a cardinal on the 13th of March, but it was
not till the 3rd of February 1876 that he was released from prison.
Having been expelled from the eastern provinces of Prussia,
he betook himself to Cracow, where his presence was made
the pretext for anti-Prussian demonstrations. Upon this he
was also expelled from Austria, and went to Rome, whence,
in spite of his removal from office, which was decreed on the 15th
of April 1874, he continued to direct the affairs of his diocese,
for which he was on several occasions from 1877 to 1879 condemned
<i>in absentia</i> by the Prussian government for &ldquo;usurpation
of episcopal rights.&rdquo; It was not till 1885 that Ledochowski resolved
to resign his archbishopric, in which he was succeeded by
Dinder at the end of the year. Ledochowski&rsquo;s return in 1884
was forbidden by the Prussian government (although the
<i>Kulturkampf</i> had now abated), on account of his having stirred
up anew the Polish nationalist agitation. He passed the closing
years of his life in Rome. In 1892 he became prefect of the
Congregation of the Propaganda, and he died in Rome on the
22nd of July 1902.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEDRU-ROLLIN, ALEXANDRE AUGUSTE<a name="ar179" id="ar179"></a></span> (1807-1874),
French politician, was the grandson of Nicolas Philippe Ledru,
the celebrated quack doctor known as &ldquo;Comus&rdquo; under Louis
XIV., and was born in a house that was once Scarron&rsquo;s, at
Fontenay-aux-Roses (Seine), on the 2nd of February 1807. He
had just begun to practise at the Parisian bar before the revolution
of July, and was retained for the Republican defence in
most of the great political trials of the next ten years. In 1838
he bought for 330,000 francs Desir√© Dalloz&rsquo;s place in the Court
of Cassation. He was elected deputy for Le Mans in 1841 with
hardly a dissentient voice; but for the violence of his electoral
speeches he was tried at Angers and sentenced to four months&rsquo;
imprisonment and a fine, against which he appealed successfully
on a technical point. He made a rich and romantic marriage in
1843, and in 1846 disposed of his charge at the Court of Cassation
to give his time entirely to politics. He was now the recognized
leader of the working-men of France. He had more authority
in the country than in the Chamber, where the violence of his
oratory diminished its effect. He asserted that the fortifications
of Paris were directed against liberty, not against foreign invasion,
and he stigmatized the law of regency (1842) as an audacious
usurpation. Neither from official Liberalism nor from the press
did he receive support; even the Republican <i>National</i> was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>360</span>
opposed to him because of his championship of labour. He
therefore founded <i>La R√©forme</i> in which to advance his propaganda.
Between Ledru-Rollin and Odilon Barrot with the other
chiefs of the &ldquo;dynastic Left&rdquo; there were acute differences,
hardly dissimulated even during the temporary alliance which
produced the campaign of the banquets. It was the speeches
of Ledru-Rollin and Louis Blanc at working-men&rsquo;s banquets in
Lille, Dijon and Ch√¢lons that really heralded the revolution.
Ledru-Rollin prevented the appointment of the duchess of
Orleans as regent in 1848. He and Lamartine held the tribune
in the Chamber of Deputies until the Parisian populace stopped
serious discussion by invading the Chamber. He was minister
of the interior in the provisional government, and was also a
member of the executive committee<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> appointed by the Constituent
Assembly, from which Louis Blanc and the extremists
were excluded. At the crisis of the 15th of May he definitely
sided with Lamartine and the party of order against the proletariat.
Henceforward his position was a difficult one. He
never regained his influence with the working classes, who
considered they had been betrayed; but to his short ministry
belongs the credit of the establishment of a working system of
universal suffrage. At the presidential election in December
he was put forward as the Socialist candidate, but secured only
370,000 votes. His opposition to the policy of President Louis
Napoleon, especially his Roman policy, led to his moving the
impeachment of the president and his ministers. The motion
was defeated, and next day (June 13, 1849) he headed what he
called a peaceful demonstration, and his enemies armed insurrection.
He himself escaped to London where he joined the executive
of the revolutionary committee of Europe, with Kossuth and
Mazzini among his colleagues. He was accused of complicity
in an obscure attempt (1857) against the life of Napoleon III.,
and condemned in his absence to deportation. √âmile Ollivier
removed the exceptions from the general amnesty in 1870, and
Ledru-Rollin returned to France after twenty years of exile.
Though elected in 1871 in three departments he refused to sit in
the National Assembly, and took no serious part in politics
until 1874 when he was returned to the Assembly as member for
Vaucluse. He died on the 31st of December of that year.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEDYARD, JOHN<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> (1751-1789), American traveller, was born
in Groton, Connecticut, U.S.A. After vainly trying law and
theology, Ledyard adopted a seaman&rsquo;s life, and, coming to
London, was engaged as corporal of marines by Captain Cook
for his third voyage (1776). On his return (1778) Ledyard had
to give up to the Admiralty his copious journals, but afterwards
published, from memory, a meagre narrative of his experiences&mdash;herein
giving the only account of Cook&rsquo;s death by an eye-witness
(Hartford, U.S.A., 1783). He continued in the British service
till 1782, when he escaped, off Long Island. In 1784 he revisited
Europe, to organize an expedition to the American North-West.
Having failed in his attempts, he decided to reach his goal by
travelling across Europe and Asia. Baffled in his hopes of
crossing the Baltic on the ice (Stockholm to Abo), he walked
right round from Stockholm to St Petersburg, where he arrived
barefoot and penniless (March 1787). Here he made friends with
Pallas and others, and accompanied Dr Brown, a Scotch physician
in the Russian service, to Siberia. Ledyard left Dr Brown at
Barnaul, went on to Tomsk and Irkutsk, visited Lake Baikal,
and descended the Lena to Yakutsk (18th of September 1787).
With Captain Joseph Billings, whom he had known on Cook&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Resolution,&rdquo; he returned to Irkutsk, where he was arrested,
deported to the Polish frontier, and banished from Russia for
ever. Reaching London, he was engaged by Sir Joseph Banks
and the African Association to explore overland routes from
Alexandria to the Niger, but in Cairo he succumbed to a dose
of vitriol (17th of January 1789). Though a born explorer,
little resulted from his immense but ill-directed activities.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEE, ARTHUR<a name="ar182" id="ar182"></a></span> (1740-1792), American diplomatist, brother
of Richard Henry Lee, was born at Stratford, Westmoreland
county, Virginia, on the 20th of December 1740. He was
educated at Eton, studied medicine at Edinburgh, practised as
a physician in Williamsburg, Virginia, read law at the Temple,
London, in 1766-1770, and practised law in London in 1770-1776.
He was an intimate of John Wilkes, whom he aided in one of his
London campaigns. In 1770-1775 he served as London agent
for Massachusetts, second to Benjamin Franklin, whom he
succeeded in 1775. At that time he had shown great ability as
a pamphleteer, having published in London <i>The Monitor</i> (1768),
seven essays previously printed in Virginia; <i>The Political
Detection: or the Treachery and Tyranny of Administration, both
at Home and Abroad</i> (1770), signed &ldquo;Junius Americanus&rdquo;; and
<i>An Appeal to the Justice and Interests of the People of Great
Britain in the Present Disputes with America</i> (1774), signed
&ldquo;An Old Member of Parliament.&rdquo; In December 1775 the
Committee of Secret Correspondence of Congress chose him its
European agent principally for the purpose of ascertaining the
views of France, Spain, and other European countries regarding
the war between the colonies and Great Britain. In October
1776 he was appointed, upon the refusal of Jefferson, on the
commission with Franklin and Silas Deane to negotiate a treaty
of alliance, amity and commerce with France, and also to
negotiate with other European governments. His letters to
Congress, in which he expressed his suspicion of Deane&rsquo;s business
integrity and criticized his accounts, resulted in Deane&rsquo;s recall;
and other letters impaired the confidence of Congress in Franklin,
of whom he was especially jealous. Early in 1777 he went to
Spain as American commissioner, but received no official
recognition, was not permitted to proceed farther than Burgos,
and accomplished nothing; until the appointment of Jay,
however, he continued to act as commissioner to Spain, held
various conferences with the Spanish minister in Paris, and in
January 1778 secured a promise of a loan of 3,000,000 livres,
only a small part of which (some 170,000 livres) was paid. In
June 1777 he went to Berlin, where, as in Spain, he was not
officially recognized. Although he had little to do with the
negotiations, he signed with Franklin and Deane in February
1778 the treaties between the United States and France. Having
become unpopular at the courts of France and Spain, Lee was
recalled in 1779, and returned to the United States in September
1780. He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates in
1781 and a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1782-1785.
With Oliver Wolcott and Richard Butler he negotiated a treaty
with the Six Nations, signed at Fort Stanwix on the 22nd of
October 1784, and with George Clark and Richard Butler a
treaty with the Wyandot, Delaware, Chippewa and Ottawa
Indians, signed at Ft. McIntosh on the 21st of January 1785.
He was a member of the treasury board in 1784-1789. He
strongly opposed the constitution, and after its adoption retired
to his estate at Urbana, Virginia, where he died on the 12th of
December 1792.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEE, FITZHUGH<a name="ar183" id="ar183"></a></span> (1835-1905), American cavalry general,
was born at Clermont, in Fairfax county, Virginia, on the 19th
of November 1835. He was the grandson of &ldquo;Light Horse
Harry&rdquo; Lee, and the nephew of Robert E. Lee. His father,
Sydney Smith Lee, was a fleet captain under Commodore Perry
in Japanese waters and rose to the rank of commodore; his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>361</span>
mother was a daughter of George Mason. Graduating from
West Point in 1856, he was appointed to the 2nd Cavalry,
which was commanded by Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston,
and in which his uncle, Robert E. Lee, was lieutenant-colonel.
As a cavalry subaltern he distinguished himself by his gallant
conduct in actions with the Comanches in Texas, and was severely
wounded in 1859. In May 1860 he was appointed instructor
of cavalry at West Point, but resigned on the secession of
Virginia. Lee was at once employed in the organization of the
forces of the South, and served at first as a staff officer to General
R. S. Ewell, and afterwards, from September 1861, as lieutenant-colonel,
and from April 1862 as colonel of the First Virginia
Cavalry in the Army of Northern Virginia. He became brigadier-general
on General J. E. B. Stuart&rsquo;s recommendation on the
25th of July 1862, and served under that general throughout
the Virginian campaigns of 1862 and 1863, becoming major-general
on the 3rd of September 1863. He conducted the cavalry
action of Beverly Ford (17th March 1863) with skill and success.
In the Wilderness and Petersburg campaigns he was constantly
employed as a divisional commander under Stuart, and, after
Stuart&rsquo;s death, under General Wade Hampton. He took part
in Early&rsquo;s campaign against Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley,
and at Winchester (19th Sept. 1864) three horses were shot under
him and he was severely wounded. On General Hampton&rsquo;s
being sent to assist General Joseph E. Johnston in North
Carolina, the command of the whole of General Lee&rsquo;s cavalry
devolved upon Fitzhugh Lee early in 1865, but the surrender
of Appomattox followed quickly upon the opening of the
campaign. Fitzhugh Lee himself led the last charge of the
Confederates on the 9th of April that year at Farmville.</p>

<p>After the war he devoted himself to farming in Stafford
county, Virginia, and was conspicuous in his efforts to reconcile
the Southern people to the issue of the war, which he regarded as
a final settlement of the questions at issue. In 1875 he attended
the Bunker Hill centenary at Boston, Mass., and delivered a
remarkable address. In 1885 he was a member of the board of
visitors of West Point, and from 1886 to 1890 was governor of
Virginia. In April 1896 he was appointed by President Cleveland
consul-general at Havana, with duties of a diplomatic and
military character added to the usual consular business. In this
post (in which he was retained by President McKinley) he was
from the first called upon to deal with a situation of great difficulty,
which culminated with the destruction of the &ldquo;Maine&rdquo; (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spanish-American War</a></span>). Upon the declaration of war between
Spain and the United States he re-entered the army. He was
one of the three ex-Confederate general officers who were made
major-generals of United States Volunteers. Fitzhugh Lee
commanded the VII. army corps, but took no part in the actual
operations in Cuba. He was military governor of Havana and
Pinar del Rio in 1899, subsequently commanded the department

<p><span class="bold">LEE, GEORGE ALEXANDER<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span> (1802-1851), English musician,
was born in London, the son of Henry Lee, a pugilist and innkeeper.
He became &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; to Lord Barrymore, and his singing
led to his being educated for the musical profession. After
appearing as a tenor at the theatres in Dublin and London,
he joined in producing opera at the Tottenham Street theatre
in 1829, and afterwards was connected with musical productions
at Drury Lane and Covent Garden. He married Mrs Waylett,
a popular singer. Lee composed music for a number of plays,
and also many songs, including the popular &ldquo;Come where the
Aspens quiver,&rdquo; and for a short time had a music-selling business
in the Quadrant. He died on the 8th of October 1851.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEE, HENRY<a name="ar185" id="ar185"></a></span> (1756-1818), American general, called &ldquo;Light
Horse Harry,&rdquo; was born near Dumfries, Virginia, on the 29th
of January 1756. His father was first cousin to Richard Henry
Lee. With a view to a legal career he graduated (1773) at
Princeton, but soon afterwards, on the outbreak of the War of
Independence, he became an officer in the patriot forces. He
served with great distinction under Washington, and in 1778
was promoted major and given the command of a small irregular
corps, with which he won a great reputation as a leader of light
troops. His services on the outpost line of the army earned for
him the soubriquet of &ldquo;Light Horse Harry.&rdquo; His greatest
exploit was the brilliant surprise of Paulus Hook, N.J., on the
19th of August 1779; for this feat he received a gold medal,
a reward given to no other officer below general&rsquo;s rank in the
whole war. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel 1780, and sent
with a picked corps of dragoons to the southern theatre of
war. Here he rendered invaluable services in victory and defeat,
notably at Guilford Court House, Camden and Eutaw Springs.
He was present at Cornwallis&rsquo;s surrender at Yorktown, and afterwards
left the army owing to ill-health. From 1786 to 1788 he
was a delegate to the Confederation Congress, and in the last-named
year in the Virginia convention he favoured the adoption
of the Federal constitution. From 1789 to 1791 he served in
the General Assembly, and from 1791 to 1794 was governor of
Virginia. In 1794 Washington sent him to help in the suppression
of the &ldquo;Whisky Insurrection&rdquo; in western Pennsylvania.
A new county of Virginia was named after him during his
governorship. He was a major-general in 1798-1800. From
1799 to 1801 he served in Congress. He delivered the address
on the death of Washington which contained the famous phrase,
&ldquo;first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his
countrymen.&rdquo; Soon after the War of 1812 broke out, Lee,
while helping to resist the attack of a mob on his friend, A. C.
Hanson, editor of the Baltimore <i>Federal Republican</i>, which had
opposed the war, received grave injuries, from which he never
recovered. He died at the house of General Nathanael Greene
on Cumberland Island, Georgia, on the 25th of March 1818.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEE, NATHANIEL<a name="ar187" id="ar187"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1653-1692), English dramatist, son of
Dr Richard Lee, a Presbyterian divine, was born probably in
1653. His father was rector of Hatfield, and held many preferments
under the Commonwealth. He was chaplain to General
Monk, afterwards duke of Albemarle, and after the Restoration
he conformed to the Church of England, abjuring his former
opinions, especially his approval of Charles I.&rsquo;s execution.
Nathaniel Lee was educated at Westminster school, and at
Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his B.A. degree in 1668.
Coming to London under the patronage, it is said, of the duke
of Buckingham, he tried to earn his living as an actor, but though
he was an admirable reader, his acute stage fright made acting
impossible. His earliest play, <i>Nero, Emperor of Rome</i>, was acted
in 1675 at Drury Lane. Two tragedies written in rhymed
heroic couplets, in imitation of Dryden, followed in 1676&mdash;<i>Sophonisba,
or Hannibal&rsquo;s Overthrow and Gloriana, or the Court
of Augustus Caesar</i>. Both are extravagant in design and treatment.
Lee made his reputation in 1677 with a blank verse
tragedy, <i>The Rival Queens, or the Death of Alexander the Great</i>.
The play, which treats of the jealousy of Alexander&rsquo;s first wife,
Roxana, for his second wife, Statira, was, in spite of much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>362</span>
bombast, a favourite on the English stage down to the days of
Edmund Kean. <i>Mithridates, King of Pontus</i> (acted 1678),
<i>Theodosius, or the Force of Love</i> (acted 1680), <i>Caesar Borgia</i>
(acted 1680)&mdash;an imitation of the worst blood and thunder
Elizabethan tragedies&mdash;<i>Lucius Junius Brutus, Father of His
Country</i> (acted 1681), and <i>Constantine the Great</i> (acted 1684)
followed. <i>The Princess of Cleve</i> (1681) is a gross adaptation of
Madame de La Fayette&rsquo;s exquisite novel of that name. <i>The
Massacre of Paris</i> (published 1690) was written about this time.
Lee had given offence at court by his <i>Lucius Junius Brutus</i>,
which had been suppressed after its third representation for some
lines on Tarquin&rsquo;s character that were taken to be a reflection on
Charles II. He therefore joined with Dryden, who had already
admitted him as a collaborator in an adaptation of <i>Oedipus</i>,
in <i>The Duke of Guise</i> (1683), a play which directly advocated
the Tory point of view. In it part of the <i>Massacre of Paris</i>
was incorporated. Lee was now thirty years of age, and had
already achieved a considerable reputation. But he had lived
in the dissipated society of the earl of Rochester and his associates,
and imitated their excesses. As he grew more disreputable,
his patrons neglected him, and in 1684 his mind was completely
unhinged. He spent five years in Bethlehem Hospital, and
recovered his health. He died in a drunken fit in 1692, and was
buried in St Clement Danes, Strand, on the 6th of May.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEE, RICHARD HENRY<a name="ar188" id="ar188"></a></span> (1732-1794), American statesman
and orator, was born at Stratford, in Westmoreland county,
Virginia, on the 20th of January 1732, and was one of six distinguished
sons of Thomas Lee (d. 1750), a descendant of an
old Cavalier family, the first representative of which in America
was Richard Lee, who was a member of the privy council, and
early in the reign of Charles I. emigrated to Virginia. Richard
Henry Lee received an academic education in England, then
spent a little time in travel, returned to Virginia in 1752, having
come into possession of a fine property left him by his father,
and for several years applied himself to varied studies. When
twenty-five he was appointed justice of the peace of Westmoreland
county, and in the same year was chosen a member of the
Virginia House of Burgesses, in which he served from 1758 to
1775. He kept a diffident silence during two sessions, his first
speech being in strong opposition to slavery, which he proposed
to discourage and eventually to abolish, by imposing a heavy
tax on all further importations. He early allied himself with
the Patriot or Whig element in Virginia, and in the years immediately
preceding the War of Independence was conspicuous as an
opponent of the arbitrary measures of the British ministry.
In 1768, in a letter to John Dickinson of Pennsylvania, he suggested
a private correspondence among the friends of liberty
in the different colonies, and in 1773 he became a member of the
Virginia Committee of Correspondence.</p>

<p>Lee was one of the delegates from Virginia to the first Continental
Congress at Philadelphia in 1774, and prepared the
address to the people of British America, and the second address
to the people of Great Britain, which are among the most
effective papers of the time. In accordance with instructions
given by the Virginia House of Burgesses, Lee introduced in
Congress, on the 7th of June 1776, the following famous resolutions:
(1) &ldquo;that these united colonies are, and of right ought
to be, free and independent states, that they are absolved from
all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connexion
between them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought
to be, totally dissolved&rdquo;; (2) &ldquo;that it is expedient to take the
most effectual measures for forming foreign alliances&rdquo;; and
(3) &ldquo;that a plan of confederation be prepared and transmitted
to the respective colonies for their consideration and approbation.&rdquo;
After debating the first of these resolutions for three
days, Congress resolved that the further consideration of it
should be postponed until the 1st of July, but that a committee
should be appointed to prepare a declaration of independence.
The illness of Lee&rsquo;s wife prevented him from being a member of
that committee, but his first resolution was adopted on the 2nd
of July, and the Declaration of Independence, prepared principally
by Thomas Jefferson, was adopted two days later. Lee
was in Congress from 1774 to 1780, and was especially prominent
in connexion with foreign affairs. He was a member of the
Virginia House of Delegates in 1777, 1780-1784 and 1786-1787;
was in Congress again from 1784 to 1787, being president in 1784-1786;
and was one of the first United States senators chosen
from Virginia after the adoption of the Federal constitution.
Though strongly opposed to the adoption of that constitution,
owing to what he regarded as its dangerous infringements upon
the independent power of the states, he accepted the place
of senator in hope of bringing about amendments, and proposed
the Tenth Amendment in substantially the form in which it
was adopted. He became a warm supporter of Washington&rsquo;s
administration, and his prejudices against the constitution were
largely removed by its working in practice. He retired from
public life in 1792, and died at Chantilly, in Westmoreland
county, on the 19th of June 1794.</p>

<p>His brother, <span class="sc">William Lee</span> (1739-1795), was a diplomatist
during the War of Independence. He accompanied his brother,
Arthur Lee (<i>q.v.</i>), to England in 1766 to engage in mercantile
pursuits, joined the Wilkes faction, and in 1775 was elected
an alderman of London, then a life-position. In April 1777,
however, he received notice of his appointment by the Committee
of Secret Correspondence in America to act with Thomas Morris
as commercial agent at Nantes. He went to Paris and became
involved in his brother&rsquo;s opposition to Franklin and Deane. In
May 1777 Congress chose William Lee commissioner to the courts
of Vienna and Berlin, but he gained recognition at neither.
In September 1778, however, while at Aix-la-Chapelle, he
negotiated a plan of a treaty with Jan de Neufville, who
represented Van Berckel, pensionary of Amsterdam. It was a
copy of this proposed treaty which, on falling into the hands of
the British on the capture of Henry Laurens, the duly appointed
minister to the Netherlands, led to Great Britain&rsquo;s declaration
of war against the Netherlands in December 1780. Lee was
recalled from his mission to Vienna and Berlin in June 1779,
without being required to return to America. He resigned his
post as an alderman of London in January 1780, and returned
to Virginia about 1784.</p>

<p>Another brother, <span class="sc">Francis Lightfoot Lee</span> (1734-1797),
was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1770-1775.
In 1775-1779 he was a delegate to the Continental Congress,
and as such signed the Declaration of Independence. He served
on the committee which drafted the Articles of Confederation,
and contended that there should be no treaty of peace with
Great Britain which did not grant to the United States both
the right to the Newfoundland fisheries and the free navigation
of the Mississippi. After retiring from Congress he served in
1780-1782 in the Virginia Senate.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEE, ROBERT EDWARD<a name="ar189" id="ar189"></a></span> (1807-1870), American soldier,
general in the Confederate States army, was the youngest son
of major-general Henry Lee, called &ldquo;Light Horse Harry.&rdquo; He
was born at Stratford, Westmoreland county, Virginia, on the
19th of January 1807, and entered West Point in 1825. Graduating
four years later second in his class, he was given a commission
in the U.S. Engineer Corps. In 1831 he married Mary, daughter
of G. W. P. Custis, the adopted son of Washington and the grandson
of Mrs Washington. In 1836 he became first lieutenant,
and in 1838 captain. In this rank he took part in the Mexican
War, repeatedly winning distinction for conduct and bravery.
He received the brevets of major for Cerro Gordo, lieut.-colonel
for Contreras-Churubusco and colonel for Chapultepec.
After the war he was employed in engineer work at Washington
and Baltimore, during which time, as before the war, he resided
on the great Arlington estate, near Washington, which had come
to him through his wife. In 1852 he was appointed superintendent
of West Point, and during his three years here he
carried out many important changes in the academy. Under him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>363</span>
as cadets were his son G. W. Custis Lee, his nephew, Fitzhugh
Lee and J. E. B. Stuart, all of whom became general officers in
the Civil War. In 1855 he was appointed as lieut.-colonel
to the 2nd Cavalry, commanded by Colonel Sidney Johnston,
with whom he served against the Indians of the Texas border.
In 1859, while at Arlington on leave, he was summoned to command
the United States troops sent to deal with the John
Brown raid on Harper&rsquo;s Ferry. In March 1861 he was made
colonel of the 1st U.S. Cavalry; but his career in the old army
ended with the secession of Virginia in the following month.
Lee was strongly averse to secession, but felt obliged to conform
to the action of his own state. The Federal authorities offered
Lee the command of the field army about to invade the
South, which he refused. Resigning his commission, he made
his way to Richmond and was at once made a major-general in
the Virginian forces. A few weeks later he became a brigadier-general
(then the highest rank) in the Confederate service.</p>

<p>The military operations with which the great Civil War opened
in 1861 were directed by President Davis and General Lee.
Lee was personally in charge of the unsuccessful West Virginian
operations in the autumn, and, having been made a full general
on the 31st of August, during the winter he devoted his experience
as an engineer to the fortification and general defence
of the Atlantic coast. Thence, when the well-drilled Army of
the Potomac was about to descend upon Richmond, he was
hurriedly recalled to Richmond. General Johnston was wounded
at the battle of Fair Oaks (Seven Pines) on the 31st of May 1862,
and General Robert E. Lee was assigned to the command of the
famous Army of Northern Virginia which for the next three
years &ldquo;carried the rebellion on its bayonets.&rdquo; Little can be said
of Lee&rsquo;s career as a commander-in-chief that is not an integral
part of the history of the Civil War. His first success was the
&ldquo;Seven Days&rsquo; Battle&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>) in which he stopped McClellan&rsquo;s
advance; this was quickly followed up by the crushing defeat
of the Federal army under Pope, the invasion of Maryland and
the sanguinary and indecisive battle of the Antietam (<i>q.v.</i>).
The year ended with another great victory at Fredericksburg
(<i>q.v.</i>). Chancellorsville (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Wilderness</a></span>), won against odds
of two to one, and the great three days&rsquo; battle of Gettysburg
(<i>q.v.</i>), where for the first time fortune turned decisively against
the Confederates, were the chief events of 1863. In the autumn
Lee fought a war of man&oelig;uvre against General Meade. The
tremendous struggle of 1864 between Lee and Grant included
the battles of the Wilderness (<i>q.v.</i>), Spottsylvania, North Anna,
Cold Harbor and the long siege of Petersburg (<i>q.v.</i>), in which,
almost invariably, Lee was locally successful. But the steady
pressure of his unrelenting opponent slowly wore down his
strength. At last with not more than one man to oppose to
Grant&rsquo;s three he was compelled to break out of his Petersburg
lines (April 1865). A series of heavy combats revealed his
purpose, and Grant pursued the dwindling remnants of Lee&rsquo;s
army to the westward. Headed off by the Federal cavalry,
and pressed closely in rear by Grant&rsquo;s main body, General Lee
had no alternative but to surrender. At Appomattox Court
House, on the 9th of April, the career of the Army of Northern
Virginia came to an end. Lee&rsquo;s farewell order was issued on the
following day, and within a few weeks the Confederacy was at
an end. For a few months Lee lived quietly in Powhatan county,
making his formal submission to the Federal authorities and
urging on his own people acceptance of the new conditions. In
August he was offered, and accepted, the presidency of Washington
College, Lexington (now Washington and Lee University), a
post which he occupied until his death on the 12th of October
1870. He was buried in the college grounds.</p>

<p>For the events of Lee&rsquo;s military career briefly indicated
in this notice the reader is referred to the articles <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">American
Civil War</a></span>, &amp;c. By his achievements he won a high place
amongst the great generals of history. Though hampered by
lack of materials and by political necessities, his strategy was
daring always, and he never hesitated to take the gravest risks.
On the field of battle he was as energetic in attack as he was
constant in defence, and his personal influence over the men
whom he led was extraordinary. No student of the American
Civil War can fail to notice how the influence of Lee dominated
the course of the struggle, and his surpassing ability was never
more conspicuously shown than in the last hopeless stages of
the contest. The personal history of Lee is lost in the history
of the great crisis of America&rsquo;s national life; friends and foes
alike acknowledged the purity of his motives, the virtues of his
private life, his earnest Christianity and the unrepining loyalty
with which he accepted the ruin of his party.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEE<a name="ar190" id="ar190"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Legh</span>) <span class="bold">ROWLAND</span> (d. 1543), English bishop, belonged
to a Northumberland family and was educated at Cambridge.
Having entered the Church he obtained several livings owing
to the favour of Cardinal Wolsey; after Wolsey&rsquo;s fall he rose
high in the esteem of Henry VIII. and of Thomas Cromwell,
serving both king and minister in the business of suppressing
the monasteries, and he is said to have celebrated Henry&rsquo;s secret
marriage with Anne Boleyn in January 1533. Whether this
be so or not, Lee took part in preparing for the divorce proceedings
against Catherine of Aragon, and in January 1534
he was elected bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, or Chester
as the see was often called, taking at his consecration the new
oath to the king as head of the English Church and not seeking
confirmation from the pope. As bishop he remained in Henry&rsquo;s
personal service, endeavouring to establish the legality of his
marriage with Anne, until May 1534, when he was appointed
lord president of the council in the marches of Wales. At this
time the Welsh marches were in a very disorderly condition.
Lee acted in a stern and energetic fashion, holding courts,
sentencing many offenders to death and overcoming the hostility
of the English border lords. After some years of hard and
successful work in this capacity, &ldquo;the last survivor of the old
martial prelates, fitter for harness than for bishops&rsquo; robes, for
a court of justice than a court of theology,&rdquo; died at Shrewsbury
in June 1543. Many letters from Lee to Cromwell are preserved
in the Record Office, London; these throw much light on the
bishop&rsquo;s career and on the lawless condition of the Welsh marches
in his time.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>One of his contemporaries was <span class="sc">Edward Lee</span> (<i>c.</i> 1482-1544) archbishop
of York, famous for his attack on Erasmus, who replied to
him in his <i>Epistolae aliquot eruditorum virorum</i>. Like Rowland,
Edward was useful to Henry VIII. in the matter of the divorce of
Catherine of Aragon, and was sent by the king on embassies to the
emperor Charles V. and to Pope Clement VII. In 1531 he became
archbishop of York, but he came under suspicion as one who disliked
the king&rsquo;s new position as head of the English Church. At
Pontefract in 1536, during the Pilgrimage of Grace, the archbishop
was compelled to join the rebels, but he did not sympathize with
the rising and in 1539 he spoke in parliament in favour of the six
articles of religion. Lee, who was the last archbishop of York to
coin money, died on the 13th of September 1544.</p>

in London on the 5th of December 1859. He was educated
at the City of London school, and at Balliol College, Oxford,
where he graduated in modern history in 1882. In the next
year he became assistant-editor of the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i>. In 1890 he was made joint-editor, and on the
retirement of Sir Leslie Stephen in 1891 succeeded him as editor.
He was himself a voluminous contributor to the work, writing
some 800 articles, mainly on Elizabethan authors or statesmen.
While he was still at Balliol he wrote two articles on Shakespearian
questions, which were printed in the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>, and in 1884 he published a book on Stratford-on-Avon.
His article on Shakespeare in the fifty-first volume (1897) of the

by George Colman at the Haymarket Theatre on the 5th of
August 1780. The proceeds were spent in establishing a school
at Bath, where Miss Lee made a home for her sisters. Her
subsequent productions included <i>The Recess, or a Tale of other
Times</i> (1785), a historical romance; and <i>Almeyda, Queen of
Grenada</i> (1796), a tragedy in blank verse; she also contributed
to her sister&rsquo;s <i>Canterbury Tales</i> (1797). She died at her house
near Clifton on the 13th of March 1824.</p>

<p>Her sister, <span class="sc">Harriet Lee</span> (1757-1851), published in 1786 a
novel written in letters, <i>The Errors of Innocence</i>. <i>Clara Lennox</i>
followed in 1797. Her chief work is the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> (1797-1805),
a series of twelve stories which became very popular.
Lord Byron dramatized one of the tales, &ldquo;Kruitzner,&rdquo; as <i>Werner,
or the Inheritance</i>. She died at Clifton on the 1st of August 1851.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEE, STEPHEN DILL<a name="ar193" id="ar193"></a></span> (1833-1908), Confederate general in
the American Civil War, came of a family distinguished in the
history of South Carolina, and was born at Charleston, S.C.,
on the 22nd of September 1833. Graduating from West Point
in 1854, he served for seven years in the United States army
and resigned in 1861 on the secession of South Carolina. He
was aide de camp to General Beauregard in the attack on Fort
Sumter, and captain commanding a light battery in General
Johnston&rsquo;s army later in the year 1861. Thereafter, by successive
steps, each gained by distinguished conduct on the field
of battle, he rose to the rank of brigadier-general in November
1862, being ordered to take command of defences at Vicksburg.
He served at this place with great credit until its surrender
to General Grant in July 1863, and on becoming a prisoner of
war, he was immediately exchanged and promoted major-general.
His regimental service had been chiefly with artillery, but he
had generally worked with and at times commanded cavalry,
and he was now assigned to command the troops of that arm
in the south-western theatre of war. After harassing, as far
as his limited numbers permitted, the advance of Sherman&rsquo;s
column on Meridian, he took General Polk&rsquo;s place as commander
of the department of Mississippi. In June 1864, on Hood&rsquo;s
promotion to command the Army of Tennessee, S. D. Lee was
made a lieutenant-general and assigned to command Hood&rsquo;s
old corps in that army. He fought at Atlanta and Jonesboro
and in the skirmishing and man&oelig;uvring along middle
Tennessee which ended in the great crisis of Nashville and the
&ldquo;March to the Sea.&rdquo; Lee&rsquo;s corps accompanied Hood in the
bold advance to Nashville, and fought in the battles of Franklin
and Nashville, after which, in the rout of the Confederate army
Lee kept his troops closed up and well in hand, and for three
consecutive days formed the fighting rearguard of the otherwise
disintegrated army. Lee was himself wounded, but did not
give up the command until an organized rearguard took over
the post of danger. On recovery he joined General J. E. Johnston
in North Carolina, and he surrendered with Johnston in April
1865. After the war he settled in Mississippi, which was his
wife&rsquo;s state and during the greater part of the war his own
territorial command, and devoted himself to planting. He
was president of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of
Mississippi from 1880 to 1899, took some part in state politics
and was an active member&mdash;at the time of his death commander-in-chief&mdash;of
the &ldquo;United Confederate Veterans&rdquo; society. He
died at Vicksburg on the 28th of May 1908.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEE,<a name="ar194" id="ar194"></a></span> a township of Berkshire county, in western Massachusetts,
U.S.A. Pop. (1900) 3596; (1905) 3972; (1910) 4106.
The township is traversed by the New York, New Haven &amp;
Hartford railway, covers an area of 22¬Ω sq. m., and includes the
village of Lee, 10 m. S. of Pittsfield, East Lee, adjoining it on
the S.E., and South Lee, about 3 m. to the S.W. Lee and South
Lee are on, and East Lee is near, the Housatonic river. The
eastern part of the township is generally hilly, reaching a maximum
altitude of about 2200 ft., and there are two considerable
bodies of water&mdash;Laurel Lake in the N.W. (partly in Lenox)
and Goose Pond, in the S.E. (partly in Tyringham). The
region is healthy as well as beautiful, and is much frequented as a
summer resort. Memorial Hall was built in memory of the
soldiers from Lee who died during the Civil War. The chief
manufactures are paper and wire, and from the quarries near the
village of Lee is obtained an excellent quality of marble; these
quarries furnished the marble for the extension of the Capitol
at Washington, for St Patrick&rsquo;s cathedral in New York City
and for the Lee High School and the Lee Public Library (1908).
Lime is quarried in the township. Lee was formerly a paper-manufacturing
place of great importance. The first paper mill
in the township was built in South Lee in 1806, and for a time
more paper was made in Lee than in any other place in the
United States; the Housatonic Mill in Lee was probably the first
(1867) in the United States to manufacture paper from wood pulp.</p>

<p>The first settlement within the present township of Lee was
made in 1760. The township was formed from parts of Great
Barrington and Washington, was incorporated in 1777 and was
named in honour of General Charles Lee (1731-1782). In the
autumn of 1786 there was an encounter near the village of East
Lee between about 250 adherents of Daniel Shays (many of them
from Lee township) and a body of state troops under General
John Paterson, wherein the Shays contingent paraded a bogus
cannon (made of a yarn beam) with such effect that the state
troops fled.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEECH, JOHN<a name="ar196" id="ar196"></a></span> (1817-1864), English caricaturist, was born in
London on the 29th of August 1817. His father, a native of
Ireland, was the landlord of the London Coffee House on Ludgate
Hill, &ldquo;a man,&rdquo; on the testimony of those who knew him, &ldquo;of
fine culture, a profound Shakespearian, and a thorough gentleman.&rdquo;
His mother was descended from the family of the
famous Richard Bentley. It was from his father that Leech
inherited his skill with the pencil, which he began to use at a
very early age. When he was only three, he was discovered by
Flaxman, who had called on his parents, seated on his mother&rsquo;s
knee, drawing with much gravity. The sculptor pronounced
his sketch to be wonderful, adding, &ldquo;Do not let him be cramped
with lessons in drawing; let his genius follow its own bent; he
will astonish the world&rdquo;&mdash;an advice which was strictly followed.
A mail-coach, done when he was six years old, is already full
of surprising vigour and variety in its galloping horses. Leech
was educated at Charterhouse, where Thackeray, his lifelong
friend, was his schoolfellow, and at sixteen he began to study for
the medical profession at St Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital, where he
won praise for the accuracy and beauty of his anatomical drawings.
He was then placed under a Mr Whittle, an eccentric
practitioner, the original of &ldquo;Rawkins&rdquo; in Albert Smith&rsquo;s
<i>Adventures of Mr Ledbury</i>, and afterwards under Dr John
Cockle; but gradually the true bent of the youth&rsquo;s mind asserted
itself, and he drifted into the artistic profession. He was eighteen
when his first designs were published, a quarto of four pages,
entitled <i>Etchings and Sketchings by A. Pen, Esq.</i>, comic character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>365</span>
studies from the London streets. Then he drew some political
lithographs, did rough sketches for <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i>, produced an
exceedingly popular parody on Mulready&rsquo;s postal envelope, and,
on the death of Seymour, applied unsuccessfully to illustrate
the <i>Pickwick Papers</i>. In 1840 Leech began his contributions
to the magazines with a series of etchings in <i>Bentley&rsquo;s Miscellany</i>,
where Cruikshank had published his splendid plates to <i>Jack
Sheppard</i> and <i>Oliver Twist</i>, and was illustrating <i>Guy Fawkes</i> in
sadly feebler fashion. In company with the elder master Leech
designed for the <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i> and <i>Stanley Thorn</i>, and till
1847 produced many independent series of etchings. These
cannot be ranked with his best work; their technique is exceedingly
imperfect; they are rudely bitten, with the light and shade
out of relation; and we never feel that they express the artist&rsquo;s
individuality, the <i>Richard Savage</i> plates, for instance, being
strongly reminiscent of Cruikshank, and &ldquo;The Dance at Stamford
Hall&rdquo; of Hablot Browne. In 1845 Leech illustrated <i>St Giles and
St James</i> in Douglas Jerrold&rsquo;s newly started <i>Shilling Magazine</i>,
with plates more vigorous and accomplished than those in <i>Bentley</i>,
but it is in subjects of a somewhat later date, and especially in
those lightly etched and meant to be printed with colour, that
we see the artist&rsquo;s best powers with the needle and the acid.
Among such of his designs are four charming plates to Dickens&rsquo;s
<i>Christmas Carol</i> (1844), the broadly humorous etchings in the
<i>Comic History of England</i> (1847-1848), and the still finer illustrations
to the <i>Comic History of Rome</i> (1852)&mdash;which last, particularly
in its minor woodcuts, shows some exquisitely graceful
touches, as witness the fair faces that rise from the surging water
in &ldquo;Cloelia and her Companions Escaping from the Etruscan
Camp.&rdquo; Among the other etchings which deserve very special
reference are those in <i>Young Master Troublesome or Master
Jacky&rsquo;s Holidays</i>, and the frontispiece to <i>Hints on Life, or How
to Rise in Society</i> (1845)&mdash;a series of minute subjects linked
gracefully together by coils of smoke, illustrating the various
ranks and conditions of men, one of them&mdash;the doctor by his
patient&rsquo;s bedside&mdash;almost equalling in vivacity and precision
the best of Cruikshank&rsquo;s similar scenes. Then in the &rsquo;fifties
we have the numerous etchings of sporting scenes, contributed,
together with woodcuts, to the <i>Handley Cross</i> novels.</p>

<p>Turning to Leech&rsquo;s lithographic work, we have, in 1841, the
<i>Portraits of the Children of the Mobility</i>, an important series dealing
with the humorous and pathetic aspects of London street Arabs,
which were afterwards so often and so effectively to employ the
artist&rsquo;s pencil. Amid all the squalor which they depict, they are
full of individual beauties in the delicate or touching expression
of a face, in the graceful turn of a limb. The book is scarce in its
original form, but in 1875 two reproductions of the outline
sketches for the designs were published&mdash;a lithographic issue
of the whole series, and a finer photographic transcript of six
of the subjects, which is more valuable than even the finished
illustrations of 1841, in which the added light and shade is
frequently spotty and ineffective, and the lining itself has not the
freedom which we find in some of Leech&rsquo;s other lithographs,
notably in the <i>Fly Leaves</i>, published at the <i>Punch</i> office, and in
the inimitable subject of the nuptial couch of the Caudles, which
also appeared, in woodcut form, as a political cartoon, with Mrs
Caudle, personated by Brougham, disturbing by untimely
loquacity the slumbers of the lord chancellor, whose haggard
cheek rests on the woolsack for pillow.</p>

<p>But it was in work for the wood-engravers that Leech was
most prolific and individual. Among the earlier of such designs
are the illustrations to the <i>Comic English</i> and <i>Latin Grammars</i>
(1840), to <i>Written Caricatures</i> (1841), to Hood&rsquo;s <i>Comic Annual</i>,
(1842), and to Albert Smith&rsquo;s <i>Wassail Bowl</i> (1843), subjects
mainly of a small vignette size, transcribed with the best skill
of such woodcutters as Orrin Smith, and not, like the larger and
later <i>Punch</i> illustrations, cut at speed by several engravers
working at once on the subdivided block. It was in 1841 that
Leech&rsquo;s connexion with <i>Punch</i> began, a connexion which subsisted
till his death on the 29th of October 1864, and resulted
in the production of the best-known and most admirable of his
designs. His first contribution appeared in the issue of the 7th
of August, a full-page illustration&mdash;entitled &ldquo;Foreign Affairs&rdquo;&mdash;of
character studies from the neighbourhood of Leicester Square.
His cartoons deal at first mainly with social subjects, and are
rough and imperfect in execution, but gradually their method
gains in power and their subjects become more distinctly political,
and by 1849 the artist is strong enough to produce the splendidly
humorous national personification which appears in &ldquo;Disraeli
Measuring the British Lion.&rdquo; About 1845 we have the first of
that long series of half-page and quarter-page pictures of life
and manners, executed with a hand as gentle as it was skilful,
containing, as Ruskin has said, &ldquo;admittedly the finest definition
and natural history of the classes of our society, the kindest
and subtlest analysis of its foibles, the tenderest flattery of its
pretty and well-bred ways,&rdquo; which has yet appeared. In addition
to his work for the weekly issue of <i>Punch</i>, Leech contributed
largely to the <i>Punch</i> almanacks and pocket-books, to <i>Once a
Week</i> from 1859 till 1862, to the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, where
some of his largest and best sporting scenes appeared, and to
innumerable novels and miscellaneous volumes besides, of which
it is only necessary to specify <i>A Little Tour in Ireland</i> (1859),
which is noticeable as showing the artist&rsquo;s treatment of pure
landscape, though it also contains some of his daintiest figure-pieces,
like that of the wind-blown girl, standing on the summit
of a pedestal, with the swifts darting around her and the breadth
of sea beyond.</p>

<p>In 1862 Leech appealed to the public with a very successful
exhibition of some of the most remarkable of his <i>Punch</i> drawings.
These were enlarged by a mechanical process, and coloured in
oils by the artist himself, with the assistance and under the
direction of his friend J. E. Millais.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Leech was a singularly rapid and indefatigable worker. Dean
Hole tells us, when he was his guest, &ldquo;I have known him send off
from my house three finished drawings on the wood, designed,
traced, and rectified, without much effort as it seemed, between
breakfast and dinner.&rdquo; The best technical qualities of Leech&rsquo;s
art, his unerring precision, his unfailing vivacity in the use of the
line, are seen most clearly in the first sketches for his woodcuts, and
in the more finished drawings made on tracing-paper from these
first outlines, before the chiaroscuro was added and the designs were
transcribed by the engraver. Turning to the mental qualities of
his art, it would be a mistaken criticism which ranked him as a
comic draughtsman. Like Hogarth he was a true humorist, a student
of human life, though he observed humanity mainly in its whimsical
aspects,</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Hitting all he saw with shafts</p>
<p class="i05">With gentle satire, kin to charity,</p>
<p class="i05">That harmed not.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>The earnestness and gravity of moral purpose which is so constant
a note in the work of Hogarth is indeed far less characteristic of
Leech, but there are touches of pathos and of tragedy in such of
the <i>Punch</i> designs as the &ldquo;Poor Man&rsquo;s Friend&rdquo; (1845), and &ldquo;General
F√©vrier turned Traitor&rdquo; (1855), and in &ldquo;The Queen of the Arena&rdquo;
in the first volume of <i>Once a Week</i>, which are sufficient to prove
that more solemn powers, for which his daily work afforded no scope,
lay dormant in their artist. The purity and manliness of Leech&rsquo;s
own character are impressed on his art. We find in it little of the
exaggeration and grotesqueness, and none of the fierce political
enthusiasm, of which the designs of Gillray are so full. Compared
with that of his great contemporary George Cruikshank, his work
is restricted both in compass of subject and in artistic dexterity.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEECH,<a name="ar197" id="ar197"></a></span> the common name of members of the Hirudinea,
a division of Chaetopod worms. It is doubtful whether the
medicinal leech, <i>Hirudo medicinalis</i>, which is rarer in England
than on the continent of Europe, or the horse leech, <i>Aulastoma
gulo</i>, often confused with it, has the best right to the original possession
of this name. But at present the word &ldquo;leech&rdquo; is applied
to every member of the group Hirudinea, for the general structure
and classification of which see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chaetopoda</a></span>. There are many
genera and species of leeches, the exact definitions of which are
still in need of a more complete survey. They occur in all parts
of the world and are mostly aquatic, though sometimes terrestrial,
in habit. The aquatic forms frequent streams, ponds and
marshes, and the sea. The members of this group are always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>366</span>
carnivorous or parasitic, and prey upon both vertebrates and
invertebrates. In relation to their parasitic habit one or two
suckers are always developed, the one at the anterior and the
other at the posterior end of the body. In one subdivision of
the leeches, the <i>Gnathobdellidae</i>, the mouth has three chitinous
jaws which produce a triangular bite, though the action has been
described as like that of a circular saw. Leeches without biting
jaws possess a protrusible proboscis, and generally engulf their
prey, as does the horse leech when it attacks earthworms. But
some of them are also ectoparasites. The leech has been used
in medicine from remote antiquity as a moderate blood-letter;
and it is still so used, though more rarely than formerly. As
unlicensed blood-letters, certain land-leeches are among the most
unpleasant of parasites that can be encountered in a tropical
jungle. A species of <i>Haemadipsa</i> of Ceylon attaches itself to
the passer-by and draws blood with so little irritation that the
sufferer is said to be aware of its presence only by the trickling
from the wounds produced. Small leeches taken into the mouth
with drinking-water may give rise to serious symptoms by attaching
themselves to the fauces and neighbouring parts and thence
sucking blood. The effects of these parasites have been mistaken
for those of disease. All leeches are very extensile and can
contract the body to a plump, pear-shaped form, or extend
it to a long and worm-like shape. They frequently progress
after the fashion of a &ldquo;looper&rdquo; caterpillar, attaching themselves
alternately by the anterior and the posterior sucker. Others
swim with eel-like curves through the water, while one land-leech,
at any rate, moves in a gliding way like a land Planarian, and
leaves, also like the Planarian, a slimy trail behind it. Leeches
are usually olive green to brown in colour, darker patches and
spots being scattered over a paler ground. The marine parasitic
leech <i>Pontobdella</i> is of a bright green, as is also the land-leech
<i>Trocheta</i>.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;leech,&rdquo; as an old English synonym for physician,
is from a Teutonic root meaning &ldquo;heal,&rdquo; and is etymologically
distinct from the name (O. Eng. <i>lyce</i>) of the <i>Hirudo</i>, though
the use of the one by the other has helped to assimilate the two
words.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEEDS, THOMAS OSBORNE,<a name="ar198" id="ar198"></a></span> 1st <span class="sc">Duke of</span> (1631-1712),
English statesman, commonly known also by his earlier title of
<span class="sc">Earl of Danby</span>, son of Sir Edward Osborne, Bart., of Kiveton,
Yorkshire, was born in 1631. He was great-grandson of Sir
Edward Osborne (d. 1591), lord mayor of London, who, according
to the accepted account, while apprentice to Sir William Hewett,
cloth worker and lord mayor in 1559, made the fortunes of the
family by leaping from London Bridge into the river and rescuing
Anne (d. 1585), the daughter of his employer, whom he afterwards
married.<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Thomas Osborne, the future lord treasurer, succeeded
to the baronetcy and estates in Yorkshire on his father&rsquo;s death
in 1647, and after unsuccessfully courting his cousin Dorothy
Osborne, married Lady Bridget Bertie, daughter of the earl of
Lindsey. He was introduced to public life and to court by his
neighbour in Yorkshire, George, 2nd duke of Buckingham,
was elected M.P. for York in 1665, and gained the &ldquo;first step
in his future rise&rdquo; by joining Buckingham in his attack on
Clarendon in 1667. In 1668 he was appointed joint treasurer
of the navy with Sir Thomas Lyttelton, and subsequently
sole treasurer. He succeeded Sir William Coventry as commissioner
for the state treasury in 1669, and in 1673 was appointed
a commissioner for the admiralty. He was created Viscount
Osborne in the Scottish peerage on the 2nd of February 1673,
and a privy councillor on the 3rd of May. On the 19th of June,
on the resignation of Lord Clifford, he was appointed lord treasurer
and made Baron Osborne of Kiveton and Viscount Latimer in
the peerage of England, while on the 27th of June 1674 he was
created earl of Danby, when he surrendered his Scottish peerage
of Osborne to his second son Peregrine Osborne. He was
appointed the same year lord-lieutenant of the West Riding of
Yorkshire, and in 1677 received the Garter.</p>

<p>Danby was a statesman of very different calibre from the
leaders of the Cabal ministry, Buckingham and Arlington. His
principal aim was no doubt the maintenance and increase of his
own influence and party, but his ambition corresponded with
definite political views. A member of the old cavalier party,
a confidential friend and correspondent of the despotic Lauderdale,
he desired to strengthen the executive and the royal
authority. At the same time he was a keen partisan of the
established church, an enemy of both Roman Catholics and dissenters,
and an opponent of all toleration. In 1673 he opposed
the Indulgence, supported the Test Act, and spoke against the
proposal for giving relief to the dissenters. In June 1675 he
signed the paper of advice drawn up by the bishops for the king,
urging the rigid enforcement of the laws against the Roman
Catholics, their complete banishment from the court, and the
suppression of conventicles,<a name="fa2j" id="fa2j" href="#ft2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and a bill introduced by him imposing
special taxes on recusants and subjecting Roman Catholic
priests to imprisonment for life was only thrown out as too
lenient because it secured offenders from the charge of treason.
The same year he introduced a Test Oath by which all holding
office or seats in either House of Parliament were to declare
resistance to the royal power a crime, and promise to abstain
from all attempts to alter the government of either church or
state; but this extreme measure of retrograde toryism was
successfully opposed by wiser statesmen. The king himself
as a Roman Catholic secretly opposed and also doubted the
wisdom and practicability of this &ldquo;thorough&rdquo; policy of repression.
Danby therefore ordered a return from every diocese of the
numbers of dissenters, both Romanist and Protestant, in order
by a proof of their insignificance to remove the royal scruples.<a name="fa3j" id="fa3j" href="#ft3j"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
In December 1676 he issued a proclamation for the suppression
of coffee-houses because of the &ldquo;defamation of His Majesty&rsquo;s
Government&rdquo; which took place in them, but this was soon
withdrawn. In 1677, to secure Protestantism in case of a Roman
Catholic succession, he introduced a bill by which ecclesiastical
patronage and the care of the royal children were entrusted to
the bishops; but this measure, like the other, was thrown out.</p>

<p>In foreign affairs Danby showed a stronger grasp of essentials.
He desired to increase English trade, credit and power abroad.
He was a determined enemy both to Roman influence and to
French ascendancy. He terminated the war with Holland in
1674, and from that time maintained a friendly correspondence
with William; while in 1677, after two years of tedious negotiations,
he overcame all obstacles, and in spite of James&rsquo;s opposition,
and without the knowledge of Louis XIV., effected the
marriage between William and Mary that was the germ of the
Revolution and the Act of Settlement. This national policy,
however, could only be pursued, and the minister could only
maintain himself in power, by acquiescence in the king&rsquo;s personal
relations with the king of France settled by the disgraceful
Treaty of Dover in 1670, which included Charles&rsquo;s acceptance
of a pension, and bound him to a policy exactly opposite to
Danby&rsquo;s, one furthering French and Roman ascendancy.
Though not a number of the Cabal ministry, and in spite of his
own denial, Danby must, it would seem, have known of these
relations after becoming lord treasurer. In any case, in 1676,
together with Lauderdale alone, he consented to a treaty between
Charles and Louis according to which the foreign policy of both
kings was to be conducted in union, and Charles received an
annual subsidy of ¬£100,000. In 1678 Charles, taking advantage
of the growing hostility to France in the nation and parliament,
raised his price, and Danby by his directions demanded through
Ralph Montagu (afterwards duke of Montagu) six million livres
a year (¬£300,000) for three years. Simultaneously Danby
guided through parliament a bill for raising money for a war
against France; a league was concluded with Holland, and
troops were actually sent there. That Danby, in spite of these
compromising transactions, remained in intention faithful
to the national interests, appears clearly from the hostility with
which he was still regarded by France. In 1676 he is described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>367</span>
by Ruvigny to Louis XIV. as intensely antagonistic to France
and French interests, and as doing his utmost to prevent the
treaty of that year.<a name="fa4j" id="fa4j" href="#ft4j"><span class="sp">4</span></a> In 1678, on the rupture of relations
between Charles and Louis, a splendid opportunity was afforded
Louis of paying off old scores by disclosing Danby&rsquo;s participation
in the king&rsquo;s demands for French gold.</p>

<p>Every circumstance now conspired to effect his fall. Although
both abroad and at home his policy had generally embodied
the wishes of the ascendant party in the state, Danby had never
obtained the confidence of the nation. His character inspired
no respect, and he could not reckon during the whole of his
long career on the support of a single individual. Charles is
said to have told him when he made him treasurer that he had
only two friends in the world, himself and his own merit.<a name="fa5j" id="fa5j" href="#ft5j"><span class="sp">5</span></a> He
was described to Pepys on his acquiring office as &ldquo;one of a broken
sort of people that have not much to lose and therefore will
venture all,&rdquo; and as &ldquo;a beggar having ¬£1100 or ¬£1200 a year,
but owes above ¬£10,000.&rdquo; His office brought him in ¬£20,000
a year,<a name="fa6j" id="fa6j" href="#ft6j"><span class="sp">6</span></a> and he was known to be making large profits by the sale
of offices; he maintained his power by corruption and by
jealously excluding from office men of high standing and ability.
Burnet described him as &ldquo;the most hated minister that had
ever been about the king.&rdquo; Worse men had been less detested,
but Danby had none of the amiable virtues which often counteract
the odium incurred by serious faults. Evelyn, who knew
him intimately from his youth, describes him as &ldquo;a man of
excellent natural parts but nothing of generous or grateful.&rdquo;
Shaftesbury, doubtless no friendly witness, speaks of him as
an inveterate liar, &ldquo;proud, ambitious, revengeful, false, prodigal
and covetous to the highest degree,&rdquo;<a name="fa7j" id="fa7j" href="#ft7j"><span class="sp">7</span></a> and Burnet supports his
unfavourable judgment to a great extent. His corruption,
his mean submission to a tyrant wife, his greed, his pale face
and lean person, which had succeeded to the handsome features
and comeliness of earlier days,<a name="fa8j" id="fa8j" href="#ft8j"><span class="sp">8</span></a> were the subject of ridicule,
from the witty sneers of Halifax to the coarse jests of the anonymous
writers of innumerable lampoons. By his championship
of the national policy he had raised up formidable foes abroad
without securing a single friend or supporter at home,<a name="fa9j" id="fa9j" href="#ft9j"><span class="sp">9</span></a> and
his fidelity to the national interests was now, through a very
mean and ignoble act of personal spite, to be the occasion of his
downfall.</p>

<p>Danby in appointing a new secretary of state had preferred
Sir W. Temple, a strong adherent of the anti-French policy,
to Montagu. The latter, after a quarrel with the duchess of
Cleveland, was dismissed from the king&rsquo;s employment. He
immediately went over to the opposition, and in concert with
Louis XIV. and Barillon, the French ambassador, by whom
he was supplied with a large sum of money, arranged a plan
for effecting Danby&rsquo;s ruin. He obtained a seat in parliament;
and in spite of Danby&rsquo;s endeavour to seize his papers by an order
in council, on the 20th of December 1678 caused two of the
incriminating letters written by Danby to him to be read aloud
to the House of Commons by the Speaker. The House immediately
resolved on Danby&rsquo;s impeachment. At the foot
of each of the letters appeared the king&rsquo;s postscripts, &ldquo;I approve
of this letter. C.R.,&rdquo; in his own handwriting; but they were
not read by the Speaker, and were entirely neglected in the
proceedings against the minister, thus emphasizing the constitutional
principle that obedience to the orders of the sovereign
can be no bar to an impeachment. He was charged with having
encroached to himself royal powers by treating matters of peace
and war without the knowledge of the council, with having
promoted the raising of a standing army on pretence of a war
with France, with having obstructed the assembling of parliament,
with corruption and embezzlement in the treasury.
Danby, while communicating the &ldquo;Popish Plot&rdquo; to the parliament,
had from the first expressed his disbelief in the so-called
revelations of Titus Oates, and his backwardness in the matter
now furnished an additional charge of having &ldquo;traitorously
concealed the plot.&rdquo; He was voted guilty by the Commons;
but while the Lords were disputing whether the accused peer
should have bail, and whether the charges amounted to more
than a misdemeanour, parliament was prorogued on the 30th
of December and dissolved three weeks later. In March 1679
a new parliament hostile to Danby was returned, and he was
forced to resign the treasurership; but he received a pardon
from the king under the Great Seal, and a warrant for a marquessate.<a name="fa10j" id="fa10j" href="#ft10j"><span class="sp">10</span></a>
His proposed advancement in rank was severely
reflected upon in the Lords, Halifax declaring it in the king&rsquo;s
presence the recompense of treason, &ldquo;not to be borne&rdquo;; and
in the Commons his retirement from office by no means appeased
his antagonists. The proceedings against him were revived,
a committee of privileges deciding on the 19th of March 1679
that the dissolution of parliament was no abatement of an impeachment.
A motion was passed for his committal by the
Lords, who, as in Clarendon&rsquo;s case, voted his banishment.
This was, however, rejected by the Commons, who now passed
an act of attainder. Danby had removed to the country, but
returned on the 21st of April to avoid the threatened passing
by the Lords of the attainder, and was sent to the Tower. In
his written defence he now pleaded the king&rsquo;s pardon, but on
the 5th of May 1679 it was pronounced illegal by the Commons.
This declaration was again repeated by the Commons in 1689
on the occasion of another attack made upon Danby in that
year, and was finally embodied in the Act of Settlement in 1701.</p>

<p>The Commons now demanded judgment against the prisoner
from the Lords. Further proceedings, however, were stopped
by the dissolution of parliament again in July; but for nearly
five years Danby remained a prisoner in the Tower. A number
of pamphlets asserting the complicity of the fallen minister
in the Popish Plot, and even accusing him of the murder of Sir
Edmund Berry Godfrey, were published in 1679 and 1680;
they were answered by Danby&rsquo;s secretary, Edward Christian,
in <i>Reflections</i>; and in May 1681 Danby was actually indicted
by the Grand Jury of Middlesex for Godfrey&rsquo;s murder on the
accusation of Edward FitzHarris. His petition to the king
for a trial by his peers on this indictment was refused, and an
attempt to prosecute the publishers of the false evidence in
the king&rsquo;s bench was unsuccessful. For some time all appeals
to the king, to parliament, and to the courts of justice were
unavailing; but on the 12th of February 1684 his application
to Chief Justice Jeffreys was at last successful, and he was set
at liberty on finding bail to the amount of ¬£40,000, to appear
in the House of Lords in the following session. He visited the
king at court the same day; but took no part in public affairs
for the rest of the reign.</p>

<p>After James&rsquo;s accession Danby was discharged from his bail
by the Lords on the 19th of May 1685, and the order declaring
a dissolution of parliament to be no abatement of an impeachment
was reversed. He again took his seat in the Lords as a
leader of the moderate Tory party. Though a strong Tory
and supporter of the hereditary principle, James&rsquo;s attacks on
Protestantism soon drove him into opposition. He was visited
by Dykvelt, William of Orange&rsquo;s agent; and in June 1687 he
wrote to William assuring him of his support. On the 30th of
June 1688 he was one of the seven leaders of the Revolution who
signed the invitation to William. In November he occupied
York in the prince&rsquo;s interest, returning to London to meet
William on the 26th of December. He appears to have thought
that William would not claim the crown,<a name="fa11j" id="fa11j" href="#ft11j"><span class="sp">11</span></a> and at first supported
the theory that the throne having been vacated by James&rsquo;s
flight the succession fell as of right to Mary; but as this met
with little support, and was rejected both by William and by
Mary herself, he voted against the regency and joined with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>368</span>
Halifax and the Commons in declaring the prince and princess
joint sovereigns.</p>

<p>Danby had rendered extremely important services to William&rsquo;s
cause. On the 20th of April 1689 he was created marquess of
Carmarthen and was made lord-lieutenant of the three ridings of
Yorkshire. He was, however, still greatly disliked by the Whigs,
and William, instead of reinstating him in the lord treasurership,
only appointed him president of the council in February 1689.
He did not conceal his vexation and disappointment, which
were increased by the appointment of Halifax to the office of
lord privy seal. The antagonism between the &ldquo;black&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;white marquess&rdquo; (the latter being the nickname given to
Carmarthen in allusion to his sickly appearance), which had
been forgotten in their common hatred to the French policy
and to Rome, revived in all its bitterness. He retired to the
country and was seldom present at the council. In June and
July new motions were made in parliament for his removal;
but notwithstanding his great unpopularity, on the retirement
of Halifax in 1690 he again acquired the chief power in the
state, which he retained till 1695 by bribery in parliament and by
the support of the king and queen. In 1690, during William&rsquo;s
absence in Ireland, he was appointed Mary&rsquo;s chief adviser.
In 1691, desiring to compromise Halifax, he discredited himself
by the patronage of an informer named Fuller, soon proved
an impostor. He was absent in 1692 when the Place Bill was
thrown out. In 1693 he presided in great state as lord high
steward at the trial of Lord Mohun; and on the 4th of May 1694
he was created duke of Leeds.<a name="fa12j" id="fa12j" href="#ft12j"><span class="sp">12</span></a> The same year he supported the
Triennial Bill, but opposed the new treason bill as weakening
the hands of the executive. Meanwhile fresh attacks had been
made upon him. He was accused unjustly of Jacobitism. In
April 1695 he was impeached once more by the Commons for
having received a bribe of 5000 guineas to procure the new
charter for the East India Company. In his defence, whilst
denying that he had received the money and appealing to his
past services, he did not attempt to conceal the fact that according
to his experience bribery was an acknowledged and universal
custom in public business, and that he himself had been instrumental
in obtaining money for others. Meanwhile his servant,
who was said to have been the intermediary between the duke
and the Company in the transaction, fled the country; and no
evidence being obtainable to convict, the proceedings fell to the
ground. In May 1695 he had been ordered to discontinue his
attendance at the council. He returned in October, but was
not included among the lords justices appointed regents during
William&rsquo;s absence in this year. In November he was created
D.C.L. by the university of Oxford; in December he became
a commissioner of trade, and in December 1696 governor of the
Royal Fishery Company. He opposed the prosecution of Sir
John Fenwick, but supported the action taken by members of
both Houses in defence of William&rsquo;s rights in the same year.
On the 23rd of April 1698 he entertained the tsar, Peter the Great,
at Wimbledon. He had for some time lost the real direction of
affairs, and in May 1699 he was compelled to retire from office
and from the lord-lieutenancy of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>In Queen Anne&rsquo;s reign, in his old age, he is described as &ldquo;a
gentleman of admirable natural parts, great knowledge and
experience in the affairs of his own country, but of no reputation
with any party. He hath not been regarded, although he took
his place at the council board.&rdquo;<a name="fa13j" id="fa13j" href="#ft13j"><span class="sp">13</span></a> The veteran statesman, however,
by no means acquiesced in his enforced retirement, and
continued to take an active part in politics. As a zealous
churchman and Protestant he still possessed a following. In 1705
he supported a motion that the church was in danger, and in
1710 in Sacheverell&rsquo;s case spoke in defence of hereditary right.<a name="fa14j" id="fa14j" href="#ft14j"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
In November of this year he obtained a renewal of his pension
of ¬£3500 a year from the post office which he was holding in
1694,<a name="fa15j" id="fa15j" href="#ft15j"><span class="sp">15</span></a> and in 1711 at the age of eighty was a competitor for
the office of lord privy seal.<a name="fa16j" id="fa16j" href="#ft16j"><span class="sp">16</span></a> His long and eventful career,
however, terminated soon afterwards by his death on the 26th of
July 1712.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1710 the duke had published <i>Copies and Extracts of some
letters written to and from the Earl of Danby ... in the years 1676,
1677 and 1678</i>, in defence of his conduct, and this was accompanied
by <i>Memoirs relating to the Impeachment of Thomas, Earl of Danby</i>.
The original letters, however, of Danby to Montagu have now been
published (by the Historical MSS. Commission from the MSS. of
J. Eliot Hodgkin), and are seen to have been considerably garbled
by Danby for the purposes of publication, several passages being
obliterated and others altered by his own hand.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Later Dukes of Leeds.</i></p>

<p>The duke&rsquo;s only surviving son, Peregrine (1659-1729), who
became 2nd duke of Leeds on his father&rsquo;s death, had been a
member of the House of Lords as Baron Osborne since 1690, but
he is better known as a naval officer; in this service he attained
the rank of a vice-admiral. He died on the 25th of June 1729,
when his son Peregrine Hyde (1691-1731) became 3rd duke.
The 4th duke was the latter&rsquo;s son Thomas (1713-1789), who was
succeeded by his son Francis.</p>

<p>Francis Osborne, 5th duke of Leeds (1751-1799), was born
on the 29th of January 1751 and was educated at Westminster
school and at Christ Church, Oxford. He was a member of parliament
in 1774 and 1775; in 1776 he became a peer as Baron
Osborne, and in 1777 lord chamberlain of the queen&rsquo;s household.
In the House of Lords he was prominent as a determined foe
of the prime minister, Lord North, who, after he had resigned his
position as chamberlain, deprived him of the office of lord-lieutenant
of the East Riding of Yorkshire in 1780. He regained
this, however, two years later. Early in 1783 the marquess of
Carmarthen, as he was called, was selected as ambassador to
France, but he did not take up this appointment, becoming
instead secretary for foreign affairs under William Pitt in
December of the same year. As secretary he was little more
than a cipher, and he left office in April 1791. Subsequently
he took some slight part in politics, and he died in London on the
31st of January 1799. His <i>Political Memoranda</i> were edited by
Oscar Browning for the Camden Society in 1884, and there are
eight volumes of his official correspondence in the British Museum.
His first wife was Amelia (1754-1784), daughter of Robert Darcy,
4th earl of Holdernesse, who became Baroness Conyers in her
own right in 1778. Their elder son, George William Frederick
(1775-1838), succeeded his father as duke of Leeds and his
mother as Baron Conyers. These titles were, however, separated
when his son, Francis Godolphin Darcy, the 7th Duke (1798-1859),
died without sons in May 1859. The barony passed to his
nephew, Sackville George Lane-Fox (1827-1888), falling into
abeyance on his death in August 1888, and the dukedom passed
to his cousin, George Godolphin Osborne (1802-1872), a son of
Francis Godolphin Osborne (1777-1850), who was created Baron
Godolphin in 1832. In 1895 George&rsquo;s grandson George Godolphin
Osborne (b. 1862) became 10th duke of Leeds. The name of
Godolphin, which is borne by many of the Osbornes, was introduced
into the family through the marriage of the 4th duke with
Mary (d. 1764), daughter and co-heiress of Francis Godolphin,
2nd earl of Godolphin, and grand-daughter of the great duke of
Marlborough.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEEDS,<a name="ar199" id="ar199"></a></span> a city and municipal county and parliamentary
borough in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, 185 m.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>369</span>
N.N.W. from London. Pop. (1891) 367,505; (1901) 428,968.
It is served by the Great Northern railway (Central station),
the Midland (Wellington station), North-Eastern and London
&amp; North-Western (New station), and Great Central and Lancashire
&amp; Yorkshire railways (Central station). It lies nearly in
the centre of the Riding, in the valley of the river Aire.</p>

<p>The plan of the city is in no way regular, and the numerous
handsome public buildings are distributed among several streets,
principally on the north side of the narrow river. The town
hall is a fine building in Grecian style, well placed in a square
between Park Lane and Great George Street. It is of oblong
shape, with a handsome fa√ßade over which rises a domed clock-tower.
The principal apartment is the Victoria Hall, a richly
ornamented chamber measuring 161 ft. in length, 72 in breadth
and 75 in height. It was opened in 1858 by Queen Victoria.
Immediately adjacent to it are the municipal offices (1884) in
Italian style. The Royal Exchange (1872) in Boar Lane is an
excellent Perpendicular building. In ecclesiastical architecture
Leeds is not rich. The church of St John, however, is an interesting
example of the junction of Gothic traditions with Renaissance
tendencies in architecture. It dates from 1634 and contains
some fine contemporary woodwork. St Peter&rsquo;s parish church
occupies an ancient site, and preserves a very early cross from
the former building. The church was rebuilt in 1840 at the
instance of the vicar, Dr Walter Farquhar Hook (1798-1875),
afterwards dean of Chichester, whose work here in a poor and
ill-educated parish brought him fame. The church of All Souls
(1880) commemorates him. It may be noted that the vicarage
of Leeds has in modern times commonly formed a step to the
episcopal bench. There are numerous other modern churches
and chapels, of which the Unitarian chapel in Park Row is noteworthy.
Leeds is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop, with
a pro-cathedral dedicated to St Anne. There is a large free
library in the municipal offices, and numerous branch libraries
are maintained. The Leeds old library is a private institution
founded in 1768 by Dr Priestley, who was then minister of the
Unitarian chapel. It occupies a building in Commercial Street.
The Philosophical and Literary Society, established in 1820,
possesses a handsome building in Park Row, known as the
Philosophical Hall, containing a laboratory, scientific library,
lecture room, and museum, with excellent natural history,
geological and archaeological collections. The City Art Gallery
was completed in 1888, and contains a fine permanent collection,
while exhibitions are also held. The University, incorporated in
1904, grew out of Yorkshire College, established in 1875 for the
purpose of supplying instruction in the arts and sciences which
are applicable to the manufactures, engineering, mining and
agriculture of the county. In 1887 it became one of the constituent
colleges of Victoria University, Manchester, and so
remained until its separate incorporation. The existing building
was completed in 1885, and contains a hall of residence, a central
hall and library, and complete equipments in all departments
of instruction. New departments have been opened in extension
of the original scheme, such as the medical department (1894).
A day training college is a branch of the institution. The
Mechanics&rsquo; Institute (1865) occupies a handsome Italian building
in Cookridge Street near the town hall. It comprises a lecture
room, library, reading and class rooms; and day and evening
classes and an art school are maintained. The grammar school,
occupying a Gothic building (1858) at Woodhouse Moor, dates
its foundation from 1552. It is largely endowed, and possesses
exhibitions tenable at Oxford, Cambridge and Durham universities.
There is a large training college for the Wesleyan
Methodist ministry in the suburb of Headingley. The Yorkshire
Ladies&rsquo; Council of Education has as its object the promotion of
female education, and the instruction of girls and women of the
artisan class in domestic economy, &amp;c. The general infirmary
in Great George Street is a Gothic building of brick with stone
dressings with a highly ornamental exterior by Sir Gilbert Scott,
of whose work this is by no means the only good example in
Leeds. The city possesses further notable buildings in its market-halls,
theatres, clubs, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Among open spaces devoted by the corporation to public use
that of Woodhouse Moor is the principal one within the city,
but 3 m. N.E. of the centre is Roundhay Park, a tract of 700
acres, beautifully laid out and containing a picturesque lake.
In 1889 there came into the possession of the corporation the
ground, lying 3 m. up the river from the centre of the city,
containing the celebrated ruins of Kirkstall Abbey. The remains
of this great foundation, of the middle of the 12th century, are
extensive, and so far typical of the usual arrangement of Cistercian
houses as to be described under the heading Abbey. The ruins
are carefully preserved, and form a remarkable contrast with the
surrounding industrial district. Apart from Kirkstall there are
few antiquarian remains in the locality. In Guildford Street,
near the town hall, is the Red Hall, where Charles I. lay during
his enforced journey under the charge of the army in 1647.</p>

<p>For manufacturing and commercial purposes the situation of
Leeds is highly advantageous. It occupies a central position
in the railway system of England. It has communication with
Liverpool by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and with Goole
and the Humber by the Aire and Calder Navigation. It is
moreover the centre of an important coal and iron district.
Though regarded as the capital of the great manufacturing
district of the West Riding, Leeds is not in its centre but on
its border. Eastward and northward the country is agricultural,
but westward and southward lies a mass of manufacturing towns.
The characteristic industry is the woollen manufacture. The
industry is carried on in a great number of neighbouring townships,
but the cloth is commonly finished or dressed in the city
itself, this procedure differing from that of the wool manufacturers
in Gloucestershire and the west of England, who carry out the
entire process in one factory. Formerly much of the business
between manufacturer and merchant was transacted in the cloth
halls, which formed a kind of market, but merchants now order
goods directly from the manufacturers. Artificial silk is important
among the textile products. Subsidiary to these leading
industries is the production of machine-made clothing, hats and
caps. The leather trade of Leeds is the largest in England, though
no sole leather is tanned. The supply comes chiefly from British
India. Boots and shoes are extensively manufactured. The
iron trade in its different branches rivals the woollen trade in
wealth, including the casting of metal, and the manufacture of
steam engines, steam wagons, steam ploughs, machinery, tools,
nails, &amp;c. Leeds was formerly famed for the production of
artistic pottery, and specimens of old Leeds ware are highly
prized. The industry lapsed about the end of the 18th century,
but has been revived in modern times. Minor and less specialized
industries are numerous.</p>

<p>The parliamentary borough is divided into five divisions
(North, Central, South, East and West), each returning one
member. The county borough was created in 1888. Leeds was
raised to the rank of a city in 1893. The municipal borough is
under a lord mayor (the title was conferred in 1897 on the
occasion of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s Diamond Jubilee), 16 aldermen
and 48 councillors. Area, 21,572 acres.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Leeds (Loidis, Ledes) is mentioned by Bede as the district where
the Northumbrian kings had a royal vill in 627, and where Oswy,
king of Northumbria, defeated Penda, king of the Mercians, in 665.
Before the Norman Conquest seven thanes held it of Edward the
Confessor as seven manors, but William the Conqueror granted the
whole to Ilbert de Lacy, and at the time of the Domesday Survey
it was held of him by Ralph Paganel, who is said to have raised
Leeds castle, possibly on the site of an earlier fortification. In
1207 Maurice Paganel constituted the inhabitants of Leeds free
burgesses, granting them the same liberties as Robert de Lacy had
granted to Pontefract, including the right of selling burgher land to
whom they pleased except to religious houses, and freedom from
toll. He also appointed as the chief officer of the town a reeve who
was to be chosen by the lord of the manor, the burgesses being &ldquo;more
eligible if only they would pay as much as others for the office.&rdquo;
The town was incorporated by Charles I. in 1626 under the title
of an alderman, 7 principal burgesses and 24 assistants. A second
charter granted by Charles II. in 1661 appointed a mayor, 12 aldermen
and 24 assistants, and is still the governing charter of the
borough. The woollen manufacture is said to have been introduced
into Leeds in the 14th century, and owing to the facilities for trade
afforded by its position on the river Aire soon became an important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>370</span>
industry. Camden, writing about 1590, says, &ldquo;Leeds is rendered
wealthy by its woollen manufactures,&rdquo; and the incorporation
charter of 1626 recites that &ldquo;the inhabitants have for a long time
exercised the art of making cloth.&rdquo; The cloth was then, as it is
now, made in the neighbouring villages and only finished and sold
in the town. A successful attempt was made in the beginning of
the 19th century by Mr William Hirst to introduce goods of a
superior quality which were made and finished in his own factory.
Other manufacturers followed his example, but their factories are
now only used for the finishing process. The worsted trade which
was formerly carried on to some extent has now almost disappeared.
The spinning of flax by machinery was introduced early in the 19th
century by Mr John Marshall, a Holbeck manufacturer, who was
one of the first to apply Sir Richard Arkwright&rsquo;s water frame,
invented for cotton manufacture, to the spinning of linen yarn.
The burgesses were represented in parliament by one member during
the Commonwealth, but not again until by the Reform Act of 1832
they were allowed to return two members. In 1867 they were
granted an additional member.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEEK,<a name="ar200" id="ar200"></a></span> a market town in the Leek parliamentary division of
Staffordshire, England, 157 m. N.W. from London, on the
Churnet Valley branch of the North Staffordshire railway.
Pop. of urban district (1901) 15,484. The town lies high in
a picturesque situation near the head of the river Churnet.
The church of St Edward the Confessor is mainly Decorated,
and stands in a churchyard commanding a beautiful view from
an elevation of some 640 ft. There is here a curious pillar of
Danish work ornately carved. An institute contains a free library,
lecture hall, art gallery and school of art. A grammar school
was established in 1723. In the vicinity are ruins of the Cistercian
abbey De la Croix, or Dieulacresse, erected in 1214
by Ralph de Blundevill, earl of Chester. The slight remains are
principally embodied in a farm-house. The silk manufacture
includes sewing silk, braids, silk buttons, &amp;c. Cloud Hill, rising
to 1190 ft. W. of the town, causes a curious phenomenon in the
height of summer, the sun sinking behind one flank to reappear
beyond the other, and thus appearing to set twice.</p>

<p>Leek (Lee, Leike, Leeke) formed part of the great estates of
√Ülfgar, earl of Mercia; it escheated to William the Conqueror
who held it at the time of the Domesday Survey. Later it
passed to the earls Palatine of Chester, remaining in their hands
until Ralph de Blundevill, earl of Chester, gave it to the abbey
of Dieulacresse, which continued to hold it until its dissolution.
The same earl in a charter which he gave to the town (<i>temp.</i>
John) calls it a borough and grants to his free burgesses various
privileges, including freedom from toll throughout Cheshire.
These privileges were confirmed by Richard, abbot of Dieulacresse,
but the town received no royal charter and failed to establish
its burghal position. The Wednesday market which is still
held dates from a grant of John to the earl of Chester: in the
17th century it was very considerable. A fair, also granted by
John, beginning on the third day before the Translation of
Edward the Confessor is still held. The silk manufacture which
can be traced to the latter part of the 17th century is thought
to have been aided by the settlement in Leek of some Huguenots
after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. In the 17th and
18th centuries the town was famous for its ale. Prince Charles
Edward passed through Leek on his march to Derby (1745)
and again on his return journey to Scotland. A story in connexion
with the Civil Wars is told to explain the expression
&ldquo;Now thus&rdquo; occurring on the tombstone of a citizen, who by
this meaningless answer to all questions sought escape on the
plea of insanity.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEEK,<a name="ar201" id="ar201"></a></span> the <i>Allium Porrum</i> of botanists, a plant now considered
as a mere variety of <i>Allium Ampeloprasum</i>, wild leek,
produced by cultivation. The plant is probably of Eastern
origin, since it was commonly cultivated in Egypt in the time
of the Pharaohs, and is so to the present day; while as regards
its first appearance in England both Tusser and Gerard&mdash;two
of the earliest writers on this class of subjects, the former of
whom flourished in the early part and the latter in the later part
of the 16th century&mdash;speak of it as being then commonly cultivated
and used.<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The Romans, it would appear, made great
use of the leek for savouring their dishes, as seems proved by
the number of recipes for its use referred to by Celsius. Hence
it is more than probable that it was brought to England by the
Romans. Italy was celebrated for leeks in the time of Pliny
(<i>H.N.</i> xix. c. 6), according to whom they were brought into
great esteem through the emperor Nero, derisively surnamed
&ldquo;Porrophagus,&rdquo; who used to eat them for several days in every
month to clear his voice. The leek is very generally cultivated
in Great Britain as an esculent, but more especially in Scotland
and in Wales, being esteemed as an excellent and wholesome
vegetable, with properties very similar to those of the onion,
but of a milder character. In America it is not much cultivated
except by market gardeners in the neighbourhood of large cities.
The whole plant, with the exception of the fibrous roots, is
used in soups and stews. The sheathing stalks of the leaves lap
over each other, and form a thickish stem-like base, which is
blanched, and is the part chiefly preferred. These blanched
stems are much employed in French cookery. They form an
important ingredient in Scotch winter broth, and particularly
in the national dish <i>cock-a-leekie</i>, and are also largely used boiled,
and served with toasted bread and white sauce, as in the case
of asparagus. Leeks are sown in the spring, earlier or later
according to the soil and the season, and are planted out for
the summer, being dropped into holes made with a stout dibble
and left unfilled in order to allow the stems space to swell. When
they are thus planted deeply the holes gradually fill up, and
the base of the stem becomes blanched and prepared for use,
a process aided by drawing up the earth round about the stems
as they elongate. The leek is one of the most useful vegetables
the cottager can grow, as it will supply him with a large amount
of produce during the winter and spring. It is extremely hardy,
and presents no difficulty in its cultivation, the chief point,
as with all succulent esculents, being that it should be grown
quickly upon well-enriched soil. The plant is of biennial duration,
flowering the second year, and perishing after perfecting
its seeds. The leek is the national symbol or badge of the Welsh,
who wear it in their hats on St David&rsquo;s Day. The origin of this
custom has received various explanations, all of which are
more or less speculative.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEER,<a name="ar202" id="ar202"></a></span> a town and river port in the Prussian province of
Hanover, lying in a fertile plain on the right bank of the
Leda near its confluence with the Ems, and at the junction of
railways to Bremen, Emden and M√ºnster. Pop. (1905) 12,347.
The streets are broad, well paved, and adorned with many elegant
buildings, among which are Roman Catholic, Lutheran and
Calvinist churches, and a new town hall with a tower 165 ft.
high. Among its educational establishments are a classical
school and a school of navigation. Linen and woollen fabrics,
hosiery, paper, cigars, soap, vinegar and earthenware are manufactured,
and there are iron-foundries, distilleries, tanneries
and shipbuilding yards. Many markets for horses and cattle
are held. The transit trade from the regions traversed by the
Westphalian and Oldenburg railways is considerable. The
principal exports are cattle, horses, cheese, butter, honey, wax,
flour, paper, hardware and Westphalian coal. Leer is one of
the principal ports for steamboat communication with the
North Sea watering-places of Borkum and Norderney. Leer
is a very old place, although it only obtained municipal privileges
in 1823. Near the town is the Plitenberg, formerly a heathen

<p><span class="bold">LEEUWARDEN,<a name="ar203" id="ar203"></a></span> the capital of the province of Friesland,
Holland, on the canal between Harlingen and Groningen, 33 m.
by rail W. of Groningen. Pop (1901) 32,203. It is one of the
most prosperous towns in the country. To the name of the
Frisian Hague, it is entitled as well by similarity of history as
by similarity of appearance. As the Hague grew up round
the court of the counts of Holland, so Leeuwarden round the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>371</span>
court of the Frisian stadtholders; and, like the Hague, it is an
exceptionally clean and attractive town, with parks, pleasure
grounds, and drives. The old gates have been somewhat ruthlessly
cleared away, and the site of the town walls on the north
and west competes with the park called the Prince&rsquo;s Garden
as a public pleasure ground. The Prince&rsquo;s Garden was originally
laid out by William Frederick of Nassau in 1648, and was
presented to the town by King William I. in 1819. The royal
palace, which was the seat of the Frisian court from 1603 to
1747, is now the residence of the royal commissioner for Friesland.
It was restored in 1816 and contains a portrait gallery of the
Frisian stadtholders. The fine mansion called the Kanselary
was begun in 1502 as a residence for the chancellor of George
of Saxony (1539), governor of Friesland, but was only completed
in 1571 and served as a court house until 1811. It was restored
at the end of the 19th century to contain the important provincial
library and national archives. Other noteworthy buildings
are the picturesque weigh-house (1595), the town hall (1715),
the provincial courts (1850), and the great church of St Jacob,
once the church of the Jacobins, and the largest monastic church
in the Netherlands. The splendid tombs of the Frisian stadtholders
buried here (Louis of Nassau, Anne of Orange, and
others) were destroyed in the revolution 1795. The unfinished
tower of Oldehove dates from 1529-1532. The museum of the
Frisian Society is of modern foundation and contains a collection
of provincial antiquities, including two rooms from Hindeloopen,
an ancient village of Friesland, some 16th- and 17th-century
portraits, some Frisian works in silver of the 17th and 18th
centuries, and a collection of porcelain and faience.</p>

<p>Leeuwarden is the centre of a flourishing trade, being easily
accessible from all parts of the province by road, rail and canal.
The chief business is in stock of every kind, dairy and agricultural
produce and fresh-water fish, a large quantity of which
is exported to France. The industries include boat-building and
timber yards, iron-foundries, copper and lead works, furniture,
organ, tobacco and other factories, and the manufacture of gold
and silver wares. The town is first mentioned in documents
of the 13th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEEUWENHOEK,<a name="ar204" id="ar204"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Leuwenhoek</span>, <span class="bold">ANTHONY VAN</span> (1632-1723),
Dutch microscopist, was born at Delft on the 24th of
October 1632. For a short time he was in a merchant&rsquo;s office
in Amsterdam, but early devoted himself to the manufacture
of microscopes and to the study of the minute structure of
organized bodies by their aid. He appears soon to have found
that single lenses of very short focus were preferable to the
compound microscopes then in use; and it is clear from the
discoveries he made with these that they must have been of
very excellent quality. His discoveries were for the most part
made public in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> of the Royal
Society, to the notice of which body he was introduced by R.
de Graaf in 1673, and of which he was elected a fellow in 1680.
He was chosen a corresponding member of the Paris Academy
of Sciences in 1697. He died at his native place on the 26th of
August 1723. Though his researches were not conducted on
any definite scientific plan, his powers of careful observation
enabled him to make many interesting discoveries in the minute
anatomy of man, the higher animals and insects. He confirmed
and extended M. Malpighi&rsquo;s demonstration of the blood capillaries
in 1668, and six years later he gave the first accurate description
of the red blood corpuscles, which he found to be circular in man
but oval in frogs and fishes. In 1677 he described and illustrated
the spermatozoa in dogs and other animals, though in this
discovery Stephen Hamm had anticipated him by a few months;
and he investigated the structure of the teeth, crystalline lens,
muscle, &amp;c. In 1680 he noticed that yeast consists of minute
globular particles, and he described the different structure of
the stem in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His researches in the life-history of various of the lower forms of
animal life were in opposition to the doctrine that they could be
&ldquo;produced spontaneously, or bred from corruption.&rdquo; Thus he
showed that the weevils of granaries, in his time commonly supposed
to be bred <i>from</i> wheat, as well as <i>in</i> it, are grubs hatched
from eggs deposited by winged insects. His chapter on the flea,
in which he not only describes its structure, but traces out the
whole history of its metamorphoses from its first emergence from
the egg, is full of interest&mdash;not so much for the exactness of his
observations, as for its incidental revelation of the extraordinary
ignorance then prevalent in regard to the origin and propagation of
&ldquo;this minute and despised creature,&rdquo; which some asserted to be
produced from sand, others from dust, others from the dung of
pigeons, and others from urine, but which he showed to be &ldquo;endowed
with as great perfection in its kind as any large animal,&rdquo;
and proved to breed in the regular way of winged insects. He even
noted the fact that the pupa of the flea is sometimes attacked and
fed upon by a mite&mdash;an observation which suggested the well
known lines of Swift. His attention having been drawn to the
blighting of the young shoots of fruit-trees, which was commonly
attributed to the ants found upon them, he was the first to find the
<i>Aphides</i> that really do the mischief; and, upon searching into the
history of their generation, he observed the young within the bodies
of their parents. He carefully studied also the history of the ant
and was the first to show that what had been commonly reputed
to be &ldquo;ants&rsquo; eggs&rdquo; are really their pupae, containing the perfect
insect nearly ready for emersion, whilst the true eggs are far smaller,
and give origin to &ldquo;maggots&rdquo; or larvae. Of the sea-mussel, again,
and other shell-fish, he argued (in reply to a then recent defence of
Aristotle&rsquo;s doctrine by F. Buonanni, a learned Jesuit of Rome)
that they are not generated out of the mud or sand found on the
seashore or the beds of rivers at low water, but from spawn, by the
regular course of generation; and he maintained the same to be
true of the fresh-water mussel (<i>Unio</i>), whose ova he examined so
carefully that he saw in them the rotation of the embryo, a phenomenon
supposed to have been first discovered long afterwards. In
the same spirit he investigated the generation of eels, which were at
that time supposed, not only by the ignorant vulgar, but by &ldquo;respectable
and learned men,&rdquo; to be produced from dew without the
ordinary process of generation. Not only was he the first discoverer
of the rotifers, but he showed &ldquo;how wonderfully nature has provided
for the preservation of their species,&rdquo; by their tolerance of the
drying-up of the water they inhabit, and the resistance afforded to
the evaporation of the fluids of their bodies by the impermeability
of the casing in which they then become enclosed. &ldquo;We can now
easily conceive,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that in all rain-water which is collected
from gutters in cisterns, and in all waters exposed to the air, animalcules
may be found; for they may be carried thither by the particles
of dust blown about by the winds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leeuwenhoek&rsquo;s contributions to the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>
amounted to one hundred and twelve; he also published twenty-six
papers in the <i>Memoirs of the Paris Academy of Sciences</i>. Two
collections of his works appeared during his life, one in Dutch
(Leiden and Delft, 1685-1718), and the other in Latin (<i>Opera omnia
s. Arcana naturae ope exactissimorum microscopiorum selecta</i>, Leiden,
1715-1722); and a selection from them was translated by S. Hoole
and published in English (London, <span class="correction" title="amended from 1798-1781">1781-1798</span>).</p>

Virgin Islands are owned by Great Britain and Denmark,
Holland having St Eustatius, with Saba, and part of St Martin.
France possesses Guadeloupe, Martinique, St Bartholomew

<p><span class="bold">LE FANU, JOSEPH SHERIDAN<a name="ar206" id="ar206"></a></span> (1814-1873), Irish journalist
and author, was born of an old Huguenot family at Dublin
on the 28th of August 1814. He entered Trinity College, Dublin,
in 1833. At an early age he had given proof of literary talent,
and in 1837 he joined the staff of the <i>Dublin University Magazine</i>,
of which he became later editor and proprietor. In 1837 he
produced the Irish ballad <i>Phaudhrig Croohore</i>, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>372</span>
shortly afterwards followed by a second, <i>Shamus O&rsquo;Brien</i>,
successfully recited in the United States by Samuel Lover.
In 1839 he became proprietor of the <i>Warder</i>, a Dublin newspaper,
and, after purchasing the <i>Evening Packet</i> and a large interest
in the <i>Dublin Evening Mail</i>, he combined the three papers under
the title the <i>Evening Mail</i>, a weekly reprint from which was
issued as the <i>Warder</i>. After the death of his wife in 1858 he
lived in retirement, and his best work was produced at this
period of his life. He wrote some clever novels, of a sensational
order, in which his vigorous imagination and his Irish love of
the supernatural have full play. He died in Dublin on the 7th
of February 1873. His best-known novels are <i>The House by
the Churchyard</i> (1863) and <i>Uncle Silas, a Tale of Bartram Haugh</i>
(1864). <i>The Purcell Papers</i>, Irish stories dating from his college
days, were edited with a memoir of the author by A. P. Graves

on the 20th of October 1755. At the outbreak of the Revolution
he was a sergeant in the Gardes fran√ßaises, and with many of
his comrades of this regiment took the popular side. He distinguished
himself by bravery and humanity in many of the street
fights in Paris, and becoming an officer and again distinguishing
himself&mdash;this time against foreign invaders&mdash;he was made a
general of division in 1794. He took part in the Revolutionary
Wars from Fleurus to Stokach, always resolute, strictly obedient
and calm. At Stokach (1799) he received a severe wound and
had to return to France, where he assisted Napoleon during
the <i>coup d&rsquo;√©tat</i> of 18 Brumaire. He was one of the first generals
of division to be made marshal at the beginning of the First

battle of Eckm√ºhl. He commanded the Imperial Guard in
Russia, 1812, fought through the last campaign of the Empire,
and won fresh glory at Montmirail, Areis-sur-Aube and Champaubert.
He was made a peer of France by Louis XVIII. but joined
Napoleon during the Hundred Days, and was only amnestied
and permitted to resume his seat in the upper chamber in 1819.
He died at Paris on the 14th of September 1820. Marshal
Lefebvre was a simple soldier, whose qualifications for high
rank, great as they were, came from experience and not from
native genius. He was incapable of exercising a supreme command,
even of leading an important detachment, but he was
absolutely trustworthy as a subordinate, as brave as he was
experienced, and intensely loyal to his chief. He maintained
to the end of his life a rustic simplicity of speech and demeanour.
Of his wife (formerly a <i>blanchisseuse</i> to the Gardes Fran√ßaises)
many stories have been told, but in so far as they are to her
discredit they seem to be false, she being, like the marshal,
a plain &ldquo;child of the people.&rdquo;</p>
